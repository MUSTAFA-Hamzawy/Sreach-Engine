stories from MailOnline, Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers.', '[twenty five years after the princess\'s tragic, unexpected death, the formidable tina brown, author of the explosive diana chronicles, which was an early naughties sensation, has returned to the fray. her new book, the palace papers: inside the house of windsor - the truth and the turmoil, examines how that quest to ensure the monarchy is not simply a platform for family members to seek public acclaim has turned out. even a cursory look at the royal landscape would suggest things have not gone entirely to plan. while no conventional royal historian, brown tackles her subjects with the same brio she brought to her years as a highly regarded magazine editor, first with tatler, then with vanity fair and the new yorker. her access to those who flit around the royals gives her writing an edgy authenticity. the book, she says, is the result of two years\' work - and impeccable sources. \'i talked to more than 120 people, many of whom have been intimately involved with the senior royals and their households during the turbulent years since diana died,\' she explained. the result is a tour d\'horizon of the recent travails of the royal family, which is both critical of and surprisingly sympathetic to the figure at the heart of the story: the 96-year-old queen, whose head-in-the-sand approach or \'ostriching\' she often mocks., hamid karimi, 34 from iran, pictured, who is currently in calais, said if the uk government starts transporting asylum seekers to rwanda, he will remain in france. home secretary priti patel, inset, flew to rwanda to sign off the deal which will see the british government pay for each asylum seeker to be housed and processed. migrants who could be impacted by the new policy, right, claim they are unhappy by the plan. the government wants the first flights to leave next month. channel crossings have continued in their hundreds since the announcement, but early indications show that numbers are in decline. on april 14, 562 crossed in small boats. on tuesday, the figure was 263., exclusive interview by riath al-samarrai: from white spots to yellow dots,

\'micro-organisms to adhere\'. cardi b is a fan of long nails., kensington palace have released charming photos of prince louis on the young royal\'s fourth birthday as the cambridge\'s prepare to move him and his siblings to berkshire this summer. a series of delightful images of the fifth in line to the throne, dressed casually in shorts and a grey wool star-print jumper, were taken as usual by his mother, the duchess of cambridge, earlier this month. keen photographer kate, 40, always knows how to get the best out of her children and the smile on her youngest child\'s face shows that louis is growing up to be a happy and contended little boy., prince harry might come back to the uk with his children for the queen\'s jubilee after being \'reassured\' about arrangements for their security., the duke of sussex said the invictus games 2025 will take place in vancouver and nearby whistler - which are about a three-hour flight away from his family\'s £11million mansion in

the duke of sussex wore a black hat with the white letters \'a\' and \'w\' to help publicise the charitable organisation he runs with wife meghan markle when he visited a bar in the hague for a pint last night., the duke of sussex founded the invictus games to aid the rehabilitation of injured or sick military personnel and veterans from across the globe, by giving them the challenge of competing in sporting events similar to the paralympics. harry spoke of his pride in the competitors sitting before him and told the audience: \'you have all summited your mountain. and i could not be prouder of every single one of you.\' harry said he is \'honoured\' to have served alongside \'all of you here tonight\', adding: \'thank you for your service and we\'ll see you in dusseldorf.\' it comes after he hailed the quality of the invictus games and its competitors saying it is \'way better\' than he \'ever imagined\'. the duke of sussex spoke to tv presenter jj chalmers on the final day of the 2020 games in the hague, which were delayed for two years until the past week due to the pandemic., speaking to people magazine, the duke of sussex said that he\'s \'grateful\' for his military experience, and will tell his children that \'finding your purpose is one of the most gratifying experiences\'., wearing one of her signature headscarves, her majesty, 96, was seen in the front passenger seat of a range rover leaving wood farm near sandringham in norfolk., with meghan back home in california, harry took the opportunity to pop into an irish bar for a pint of guinness in the hague last night surrounded by five bodyguards., meghan markle\'s close friend daniel martin, from seattle, commented on her hairdresser george northwood\'s instagram, writing: \'so happy i\'ll see you next month my friend.\', things got off to a smooth start as the earl and countess of wessex exchanged gifts with the prime minister of the island yesterday, days after the grenada leg of their trip was postponed at the 11th hour. it marked the beginning of their seven-day tour of the caribbean where they are also scheduled to visit two other nations, antigua and barbuda and saint vincent and the grenadines. the platinum jubilee tour was organised to mark the queen\'s 70-year reign, and it comes shortly after the duke and duchess of cambridge were criticised for some elements of their recent caribbean tour, deemed to hark back to colonial days. sophie and edward presented prime minister philip pierre with a photograph of themselves and a jubilee box as a \'token of appreciation\' when they met him at his residence on friday evening. in return, saint lucia\'s pm gave the pair a painting of one of the island\'s turtles rolled up in a long black tube, and before discovering what the gift inside the tube was, edward joked: \'it\'s not a fishing rod.\' the couple then signed the guest book to complete their first day of engagements., it comes after a recent interim report by hilary cass, former president royal college of paediatrics and child health, into treatment of children with gender identify issues., andrew neil: it is commonplace to observe that starmer is no

trump.\', juliet laurie, 63, a retired science teacher from dorset, had always loved hill-walking with her husband and walking holidays with friends, but had started finding it harder to walk as far., in a statement which has raised concerns in chișinău, deputy commander of russia\'s central military district, rustam minnekayev, said russia planned to forge a corridor between crimea, the black sea peninsula (pictured right and inset: russian troops in mariupol) which russia annexed in 2014, and the donbas in eastern ukraine (pictured left: a map showing the russian advance). he also hinted russia\'s forces could move further west into transnistria - internationally recognised as moldova - in order to protect \'oppressed\' russia speakers. but last night moldova said the statements were \'unfounded\' and that the country remained a \'neutral state\'. \'these statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the russian federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of moldova,\' said moldova\'s foreign ministry on its website. \'during the meeting, it was reiterated that the republic of moldova ... is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the russian federation.\' the suggestion by a senior russian official that moscow needs to defend supporters in a nearby country is a chilling echo of its previous justification for invading ukraine. it would mean an extended war to the west of annexed crimea, where putin\'s sea power is diminished after the sinking of the moskva., mark galeotti: he will not tolerate dissent or any opinion that contradicts his own. but around him in moscow\'s halls of power, there is increasing disquiet., emmanuel macron reportedly fumed after seeing reports of boris johnson\'s visit to kyiv. he is said to have ranted to advisers: \'he hasn\'t actually done very much since the start of this.\', the british putin stooge who conducted a menacing interview with a british captive in russia was formerly a sex blogger. graham phillips could have his passport revoked for \'war crimes\'., ang wood, mother of captured aiden aslin, said she was

contradicting reports., speaking during a news conference in new delhi, the prime minister today said the government was contemplating sending tanks to poland., vladimir putin\'s (left) poor posture during the meeting and his bloated face and neck sparked speculation about the russian leader\'s health, which has reportedly been in decline since the ukraine invasion. in a rare live appearance, putin claimed russia had \'liberated\' the besieged ukrainian city of mariupol, as he savagely ordered defence minister sergei shoigu (right) to seal off all routes out of the azovstal steelworks where defiant ukrainians are holed up \'so that even a fly cannot pass through\'. video showed putin speaking to shoigu whilst gripping the edge of the table with his right hand - so hard that it appears white - and tapping his foot consistently. shoigu does not appear to have fared any better in the eight weeks since russia invaded ukraine, with the defence minister slurring his words and reading from his notes following an apparent heart attack., the move will allow ministers to \'switch off\' controversial border checks on goods crossing the irish sea, which have been blamed for

prosecutors say was \'responsible\' for the most notorious child abduction in criminal history, has been dragged in front of detectives and formally asked: \'where were you on the night madeleine mccann disappeared?\' christian brueckner (inset), a convicted paedophile and rapist who is currently behind bars in his native germany, was told to account for his whereabouts on the evening of may 3, 2007, when the three-year-old british girl vanished from her bedroom at a resort on the algarve as her parents ate tapas with friends at a nearby restaurant. christian brueckner, who has been convicted of rape and molesting a six-year-old, was living near the mccanns\' flat in the algarve. \'if you weren\'t by the apartment she disappeared from that night, where were you?\' was one of a series of questions which the 44-year-old sex offender failed to dignify with a response. sources with knowledge of his recent prison interview, which was carried out by german authorities acting on behalf of their portuguese colleagues, say that throughout the barrage of probing questions, brueckner exercised his right to remain silent. also pictured: madeleine mccann shortly before her

debate... ¿debe un piloto que provoca bandera roja mantener su tiempo aun fastidiando al resto? la sombra del accidente de leclerc en monaco 2021 planea ahora sobre norris. vosotros: ¿qué pensáis?, el accidente de norris. el británico, por cierto, saldrá tercero mañana., así ha quedado el top-10 de la clasificación de imola. gran viernes con tramos de lluvia y de seco. nunca defrauda esta pista. para mañana y el domingo, pronóstico de seco., seguro que se ha quedado con ganas de intentarlo fernando alonso... aun así, gran viernes para el de alpine. superó, y no por poco, a su compañero. gran oportunidad para hacer un buen sábado mañana., recordemos que para la estadística, la clasificación del viernes es lo que cuenta como \'pole\'. pero será la posición de salida para mañana en la carrera al sprint... el orden de salida del domingo se decide mañana., primera pole de la temporada para verstappen. se rompe el monopolio de ferrari., ¡sesión terminada! pole para verstappen. leclerc, segundo. fernando alonso saldrá 5º por detrás de norris y magnussen., ¡norris fuera! ¡bandera roja! ¡se acabó!, empiezan todos su vuelta..., \"no tengo agarre\", dice verstappen., verstappen cierra a leclerc en la salida de boxes. vaya arrancada. fernando alonso, detrás de los dos \'cocos\' de este mundial., ¡se reanuda la q3! tres minutos para que pase absolutamente todo. trenecito en el pit lane... tensión por encontrar el hueco para marcar la vuelta., comunicado de la fia: en 5 minutos se reanuda la sesión., fernando alonso está a media décima de ser tercero. ojo que no tengamos tres minutos de infarto. sergio pérez, 7º, es la mayor amenaza... tuvo una mala vuelta el mexicano., así quedó el alfa romeo de bottas. estaba 8º..., cuatro banderas rojas en la clasificación de hoy. vaya infierno imola con el asfalto mojado. circuito muy complicado. de los que nos gustan., así está el top-10 a falta de 2\'58\". verstappen, efectivamente, levantó. parece que no habrá problema. bottas se quedó ko por un fallo mecánico en su monoplaza., tema verstappen. en la \'on board\' se veía como ha levantado en el sector 3 pero aun así ha marcado tiempo para \'pole\'. 0.7 segundos más rápido que leclerc. la bandera roja salió justo después de pasar el por meta., ¡otra bandera roja! ¡bottas fuera! se ha quedado parado el finlandés. quedan 2 minutos y 58 segundos..., ¡ojo!

¡leclerc, primero! verstappen marca el segundo mejor tiempo por 20 milésimas. espectacular., sergio pérez por detrás de norris, magnussen o bottas., susto para fernando alonso... venía con el primer sector en morado., y difícil que alguien se atreva con blandos pese a que hay zonas que no levantan \'spray\'. otras, mucho., veremos si tenemos una tanda larga o dos cortas. lo normal sería que hayan cargado combustible para los minutos que quedan. hay que quedarse en el asfalto y marcar vueltas., ¡vuelve el semáforo verde! de nuevo acción en pista., las palabras de sainz sobre su accidente:, en menos de 4 minutos se reanuda la sesión. clasificación larga... tres banderas rojas por ahora., pues ha conseguido sacar el coche magnussen. y no parece tocado el haas. buenas noticias para él., ¡bandera roja! ¡fuera magnussen! nadie con vuelta., susto para verstappen. no está tan seca, no..., \"la pista está mucho más seca de lo que pensaba\", dice leclerc., fernando alonso ya en pista. mucho movimiento. es difícil saber si va a llover más o no. información confusa. pista mojada, todos con intermedios., ¡comienza la q3! llega la lucha por la \'pole\'. charles leclerc, muy favorito., palabras de carlos sainz a \'dazn\': \"una pena porque me sentía cómodo. me queda pedir disculpas y remontar mañana\"., así quedó la tabla de tiempos en q2., ¡acaba la q2! eliminados russell, schumacher, hamilton, zhou y stroll. drama en mercedes., está también leclerc en pista. misión volver a tomar el pulso al asfalto, ahora mojado de nuevo., sale fernando alonso también., sale vettel. el alemán está en q3. querrá testear la pista de cara a la ronda definitiva. lleva intermedio, claro., seguimos sin movimiento... de hecho, stroll se baja del coche. sabe que está eliminado. y vamos a tener q3 con intermedios., desierta la pista. recordemos: russell, schumacher, hamilton, zhou y stroll están fuera., así fue el accidente de carlos sainz., llueve... y nadie sale. ojo porque igual nos quedamos con 10 minutos de q2 sin cambio alguno., ¡semaforo en verde! pit lane abierto de nuevo. caen gotas..., paraguas y chubasqueros en la grada. caen las primeras gotas. va a ser complicado mejorar los tiempos actuales si llueve. quedarían fuera russell, schumacher, hamilton, zhou y stroll. los dos mercedes, ko., actualizamos el top-10 en este momento de q2., así está el ferrari. carlos sainz ya en el \'paddock\', ha ido en moto. la sesión se reanuda en 5 minutos., ha perdido el coche entrando en curva. se le ha ido de atrás. suspensión delantera rota. saldrá mañana 10º teniendo en cuenta que tiene el pase a q3 encarrilado., ¡accidente de carlos sainz! suspensión rota. está fuera. bandera roja., sube verstappen al p1. leclerc, 4º., marca tiempo carlos sainz, y es el más rápido por ahora. buenas noticias. también fernando alonso, 3º., qué viene..., carlos sainz inicia vuelta. el primero en salir. también fernando alonso rodando ya. mucha tensión ahora mismo. una vuelta puede marcar la suerte de todos., ojo porque el radar muestra lluvia llegando al circuito... ojo que igual tenemos lío. salen todos rápido para intentar buscar vuelta en seco lo más pronto posible., ¡comienza la q2 en imola!, algo ha tenido que pasar con el alpine de ocon. no ha podido rodar en los últimos minutos. está ko en q1., por delante... dominio de ferrari, aunque se ha colado max verstappen en la fiesta. aun así, leclerc casi intratable., hamilton se ha salvado... ¡por 4 milésimas! por un suspiro supera a tsunoda., confirmado: eliminados tsunoda, gasly, ocon, latifi y albon (sin tiempo), se ha salvado hamilton de milagro... ha acabado 15º el británico., ¡acaba la q1! veremos las últimas vueltas..., buena vuelta de fernando alonso. sube al 5º. encamina el pase a q2. mientras, ocon está eliminado. en \'boxes\'. problemas para el francés., trompo latifi. con albon fuera, pinta mal la q1 para williams..., cambia cada instante la tabla de tiempos. locura en imola. lo único claro es que mandan los ferrari., mercedes salva la papeleta. por ahora... suben russell y hamilton al top-10, pero están lejísimos de cabeza una vez más., excursión para mick schumacher., dura poco. vuelan los ferrari. carlos sainz, primero. mejora la pista en cada giro. leclerc, 2º., ¡fernando alonso se pone primero! gran vuelta para el asturiano., primeros dos sectores en morado para carlos sainz, aborta en el tercero. se encontró mucho tráfico., nadie con intermedios ya. son cosa del pasado. pista seca. hay un claro carril que seguir en la trazada. todos con blandos., busca ferrari su primer tiempo. carlos sainz y leclerc no han marcado todavía crono. no deberían tener problema., ¡se reanuda la sesión! vuelven los monoplazas a pista., vaya susto se ha tenido que llevar albon..., mucho trabajo para limpiar la pista. en williams están empeñados en aligerar el monoplaza (cada vez menos pintura azul) pero esta medida ha sido algo drástica. entiéndase la broma, claro. albon se baja del coche. mañana saldrá último., aprovechamos la bandera roja para recopilar tiempos. manda stroll. fernando alonso tuvo tiempo para marcar el cuarto mejor tiempo. pero en cada giro mejora muchísimo la pista., ¡drama para albon! ha explotado uno de los frenos traseros y está dejando piezas de su williams por la pista. se para la sesión., parece el disco de freno y esto ha afectado a la suspensión trasera..., los neumáticos blandos mandan. stroll, primero. fernando alonso y sainz han salido con neumático de seco., fernando alonso en pista. carlos sainz sale ahora. buenas noticias. problemas subsanados., la primera vuelta rápida de esta q1 la marca hamilton con intermedios. por delante de russell., trabajo en el ferrari de carlos sainz. esperemos que no haya problemas. hay tiempo todavía., también con seco stroll y vettel., ojo. zhou y bottas con neumático blando. el resto, con intermedio., ¡comienza la clasificación en imola! es la hora..., leclerc se sube al coche. todos preparados. tensión en el \'paddock\'. mucho en juego. imola no es un circuito en el que sea fácil adelantar., imagen aérea del autodromo enzo e dino ferrari. esto esta muy cerca de comenzar., ¡5 minutos! va a comenzar la clasificación del gran premio de la emilia romagna. preparaos que pinta espectacular. imola nunca decepciona., sigue la f1 en dazn, suscríbete aquí, así está imola ahora mismo. situación mucho mejor a la vista este mediodía., para los despistados: así ha cambiado la \'f1 al sprint\' respecto al año pasado., en este artículo explicamos todo., ¡15 minutos! muy poco para que comience la clasificación de imola... y os pregunto: ¿para quién es hoy la \'pole\'? recordemos que esta temporada, a modo estadístico, la \'pole\' se reparte los viernes en los fines de semana de carrera al sprint., momento para recordar las palabras de fernando alonso esta mañana en rueda de prensa: \"mi coche tendrá una actualización de que vamos a probar el los libres 1 y que ojalá sea un buen paso adelante para alpine. tras esa sesión veremos si seguimos con ella (en la clasificación) por que ha supuesto una buena mejora, como esperamos, o no. en todo caso, en miami estará en los dos coches\"., veremos hasta dónde llega hoy el alpine. el asturiano guarda buenos recuerdos de esta pista., aspectos técnicos: los cambios que ha habido en los monoplazas de cara a este gran premio., entre el hermano de leclerc (arthur) y enzo trulli (el hijo de jarno) la han liado en la clasificación de f3. el monegasco, en la grava. bandera roja y veremos si esto no hace que la clasificación de f1 empiece más tarde., en mitad del dominio de ferrari, mensaje de binotto: \"no es hora de jerarquías\"., muy bonita esta \'on board\' en el coche de albon., ojo porque en f3 ya hay pilotos montando neumáticos de seco... igual llegamos a la q1 ya con condiciones de seco. vamos a ver., desde luego, la mejor imagen de marca posible para ferrari. corriendo en casa y con sensaciones inmejorables. sigue el domino de los de maranello en este inicio de mundial., os dejo algunas fotos de los libres 1. no veremos ya tanta agua en la clasificación. recordemos que era la primera vez que estos monoplazas de 2022 rodaban sobre agua..., para que os hagáis una idea, así está la pista ahora mismo. con neumáticos de lluvia los pilotos de f3 que están rodando en este instante. no llueve y se va a secar todavía más de cara a la clasificación., los tiempos de libres 1, única referencia que tenemos hasta ahora en imola. aunque la pista mejorará... domina ferrari., sigue la f1 en dazn, suscríbete aquí, la crónica de los libres 1 de nuestro compañero marco canseco desde el circuito:, - ferrari vuela sobre el agua, aunque no lloverá el resto del fin de semana., para ir entrando en calor vamos a recordar lo ocurrido en los libres 1. muchas salidas de pista, estaba complicado el trazado., ¡bienvenidos de nuevo a imola! ¡bienvenidos al autodromo enzo e dino ferrari! es viernes, sí... ¡pero tenemos clasificación! fin de semana de carrera al sprint y todos los horarios cambiados. la pista todavía mojada en la emilia romagna. humedad, fuerte viento... vamos a pasarlo bien, sin duda., ¡bienvenidos a imola! ¡bienvenidos al gran premio de la emilia romagna! tras la sesión de libres 1 pasada por agua, es momento de la hora de la verdad. y es que estamos ante el primer fin de semana de carrera al sprint de la temporada... y eso cambia todos los horarios. solamente tendremos dos sesiones de libres (uno hoy, otro mañana), mientras que la clasificación es el viernes, la carrera al sprint el sábado y la carrera tradicional, el domingo., sin embargo, vamos por partes. las carreras al sprint cambian respecto al año pasado. ya no es clasificación al sprint, sino simplemente sprint. de hecho, la \'pole\' se logrará el viernes en el aspecto estadístico, al más rápido al estilo tradicional. pero solo será a nivel estadístico, ya que saldrá primero el domingo el que gane la sprint del sábado., el segundo gran cambio es que puntuarán los ocho primeros de la carrera (esto ya lo veremos mañana, hoy todavía es pronto...). el que gane sumará 8, el segundo 7, el tercero 6 y así hasta el octavo que sumará 1. así el sprint vale para salir primero (no para la pole) y vale para sumar puntos de verdad, es como una segunda carrera aunque previsiblemente no tenga el podio y los himnos como la del domingo para no eclipsarla., en cuanto a los libres 1, ferrari ha marcado la pauta sobre el asfalto mojado de imola.leclerc, el más rápido; sainz, segundo. el resto, un

new directive aimed at helping these remarkable trees survive multiple threats.', '[ancient forests could get protection in the u.s. under a new directive aimed at helping these remarkable trees survive multiple threats., one of southern california’s oldest giant sequoias holds more leaves than there are people in china. it has stood since there were fewer people on earth than live in modern japan—more than 3,000 years. it was a seedling hundreds of years before aristotle began tutoring alexander the great—and it is still living today., in the hoh rainforest on washington state’s olympic peninsula, towering above mushrooms and damp ferns, are green, moss-draped spruces and hemlocks that were alive in the late 1500s “when sir francis bacon and johannes kepler first recognized the value of objective data over mystical portents,” scientist jerry franklin and his co-author, ruth kirk, wrote in the olympic rain forest: an ecological web. those trees “have been pushing their roots through the soil and wafting seeds into the air throughout the entire existence of science.\", these are examples of old-growth forests—one wet, one dry—both full of ancient trees with webs of roots surrounded by a complex array of life above and below ground. far more than just linking us to our past, the world’s mature and old-growth forests perform amazing ecological feats, even as they face all new threats. they support a greater diversity of life, hold cleaner water, and host surprisingly complicated communication networks made of fungi that relay messages between trees underground—even trees of different species., they hold far more carbon than younger forests, helping to protect us from our own fossil-fuel emissions. a study of six national forests in oregon showed the biggest 3 percent of trees accounted for 42 percent of forest carbon., where carbon storage is high, plant and animal diversity tends to be richer than anyplace else. in the hoh, for example, when researchers climb to the tops of trees, they sometimes find baby trees sprouting from soil on the branches. “the forest canopy has its own ecosystem—there are huge varieties of mosses and lichens and insects and birds,” says old-growth forest expert beverly law, at oregon state university. “it’s just a different world up there.”, these days, climate change poses greater threats than ever to mature and old-growth forests, bringing higher risk from wildfire, drought, excessive heat, more powerful storms, and pest invasions. but in countries across the globe from indonesia to brazil—and even in the united states, especially alaska—old-growth forests are still being logged., on april 22, 2022, to mark earth day, president joe biden came to seward park, a city park in seattle that’s home to some remnants of old-growth forest, to sign an executive order mandating the first inventory of the nation’s mature and old-growth forests. the order requires federal scientists to detail the specific threats posed to each forest., “all around this country there used to be a hell of a lot more forests like this,” biden told the small crowd., a host of prominent experts, including 135 forest scientists, had been urging biden to protect old-growth forests since he became president, explaining in a letter two days before he signed the order that “older forests provide cool, shaded forest interiors for sensitive species and those needing time to migrate and adapt to changing environments. large trees create vital habitat structure and complexity for imperiled fish, other aquatic life, and terrestrial species.\", the scientists noted that old-growth forests “store and gradually release clean drinking water for millions of americans while mitigating flood and fire impacts resulting from climate-driven increases in erratic and severe weather events. finally, such forests and legacy trees attract visitors and inspire awe, supporting recreation and rural economies.”, there is no single definition for old-growth forests, because that depends on the ecosystem. bristlecone pines can live 5,000 years. some other tree species may only live 150 years, but if they are in forests largely undisturbed by humans, researchers may still consider them old-growth. what these forests have in common is an ever-changing complexity that promotes symbioses among species., there are mosses and broken, leaning snags of branches; cracked trunks; broken treetops; multiple varieties of trees; downed “nurse logs” that host new growth as they decay; and tree canopies of varying sizes and shapes. all of those differences over time have created pockets for a wide variety of life., “there’s just a huge diversity of animals and plants, huge soil diversity,” in old-growth forests, law says. “and biodiversity—genetic biodiversity, species biodiversity—is necessary for resilience. it’s what protects forests from diseases and everything else. it’s essential for life to continue.”, one could argue that our understanding so far of old-growth forests really started with franklin, a university of washington scientist often considered the “guru of old growth.” in the 1970s and 1980s he started doing research in the douglas fir canopies of the pacific northwest. he was among the first to urge loggers to leave behind woody debris and dead snags of branches, the complex structure that helps old forests sustain life., in the 1980s, decades of clearcutting threatened to extinguish spotted owls, a shy and charismatic coffee-colored species that had come to symbolize the complex value of forests across washington, oregon, and northern california., by the early 1990s, the battle between loggers and environmentalists reached a fever pitch, and the clinton administration turned to franklin to help find a new way to manage forests. the northwest forest plan, adopted in 1994, put a stop to timber cutting on 80 percent of 24 million acres overseen by the u.s. forest service and bureau of land management., in places like canada’s british columbia or alaska’s tongass national forest, however, old-growth forests still get chopped down for lumber, but also for cardboard boxes

top stories from MailOnline, Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers.', '[twenty five years after the princess\'s tragic, unexpected death, the formidable tina brown, author of the explosive diana chronicles, which was an early naughties sensation, has returned to the fray. her new book, the palace papers: inside the house of windsor - the truth and the turmoil, examines how that quest to ensure the monarchy is not simply a platform for family members to seek public acclaim has turned out. even a cursory look at the royal landscape would suggest things have not gone entirely to plan. while no conventional royal historian, brown tackles her subjects with the same brio she brought to her years as a highly regarded magazine editor, first with tatler, then with vanity fair and the new yorker. her access to those who flit around the royals gives her writing an edgy authenticity. the book, she says, is the result of two years\' work - and impeccable sources. \'i talked to more than 120 people, many of whom have been intimately involved with the senior royals and their households during the turbulent years since diana died,\' she explained. the result is a tour d\'horizon of the

\'ostriching\' she often mocks., hamid karimi, 34 from iran, pictured, who is currently in calais, said if the uk government starts transporting asylum seekers to rwanda, he will remain in france.

the new policy, right, claim they are unhappy by the plan. the government wants the first flights to leave next month. channel crossings have continued in their hundreds since the announcement, but

russia\'s forces could move further west into transnistria - internationally recognised as moldova - in order to protect \'oppressed\' russia speakers. but last night moldova said the statements were \'unfounded\' and that the country remained a \'neutral state\'. \'these statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the russian federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial

cm) among five dominant tree species. large trees accounted for 2.0 to 3.7% of all stems (dbh ≥ 1” or 2.54 cm) among five tree species; but held 33 to 46% of the total agc stored by each species. pooled across the five dominant species, large trees accounted for 3% of the 636,520 trees occurring on the inventory plots but stored 42% of the total agc. a recently proposed large-scale vegetation management project that involved widespread harvest of large trees, mostly grand fir, would have removed ∼44% of the agc stored in these large-diameter trees, and released a large amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. given the urgency of keeping additional carbon out of the atmosphere and continuing carbon accumulation from the atmosphere to protect the climate system, it would be prudent to continue protecting ecosystems with large trees for their carbon stores, and also for their co-benefits of habitat for biodiversity, resilience to drought and fire, and microclimate buffering under future climate extremes., forest carbon accumulation is crucial for mitigating ongoing climatic change, with individual large trees storing a substantial portion of the overall carbon in living trees. globally, forests store about 862 gt carbon in live and dead vegetation and soil, with 42% of it stored in live biomass (above- and belowground; pan et al., 2011). globally, forests removed the equivalent of about 30% of fossil fuel emissions annually from 2009 to 2018 (friedlingstein et al., 2019), and 44% of that was by temperate forests. temperate forests of the united states are the largest category of land sinks in the country, consistently offsetting about 14% of the nation’s co2 emissions (epa, 2020). projections indicate that ecological systems have significant additional climate mitigation potential, with forest carbon accumulation serving as a central component of a natural climate solutions framework (griscom et al., 2017; fargione et al., 2018; moomaw et al., 2019; cook-patton et al., 2020)., large-diameter trees constitute about half of the mature forest biomass worldwide and are key to the ability of forests to accumulate substantial amounts of carbon needed to mitigate climate change (luyssaert et al., 2008; lutz et al., 2018). trees exceeding 60 cm (23.6 in) diameter at breast height (dbh) comprise ∼41% of the world’s aboveground live tree biomass (lutz et al., 2018). furthermore, on average, 50% of the live tree biomass carbon in all types of forests globally is stored in the largest 1% of trees, but the value for the united states is lower, ∼30% in the largest 1% of trees due to widespread historical logging of large trees (lutz et al., 2018). a single large tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in a single mid-sized tree of the same species (stephenson et al., 2014). the relationship between large-diameter trees and overall forest biomass suggests that forests cannot accumulate aboveground carbon (agc) to their ecological potential without large trees (lutz et al., 2018). recognition of the importance of large-diameter trees in determining global atmospheric carbon stocks has led to management recommendations to conserve existing large-diameter trees and those that will soon reach large diameters (lindenmayer et al., 2014; lutz et al., 2018; moomaw et al., 2019)., in addition to comprising a substantial portion of forest carbon storage and accumulation, large-diameter trees fulfill a variety of unique ecological roles such as increasing drought-tolerance, reducing flooding from intense precipitation events, altering fire behavior, redistributing soil water, and acting as focal centers of mycorrhizal communication and resource sharing networks (bull et al., 1997; brooks et al., 2002; brown et al., 2004; luyssaert et al., 2008; beiler et al., 2015; lindenmayer and laurance, 2017). in the united states pacific northwest (pnw), carbon dense old growth forests buffer against increasing temperatures by creating microclimates that shelter understory species from rising temperatures (frey et al., 2016; davis et al., 2019a). forests with large-diameter trees often have high tree species richness, and a high proportion of critical habitat for endangered vertebrate species, indicating a strong potential to support biodiversity into the future and promote ecosystem resilience to climate change (lindenmayer et al., 2014; buotte et al., 2020)., in the pnw region of the united states a 21-inch (∼53 cm) diameter criteria (usda forest service, 1995) was enacted in 1994 to slow the loss of large, older trees and old forest patches in national forests east of the cascade mountains crest in oregon and washington. the forests under consideration shall be referred to as “eastside forests” to be consistent with united states forest service (usfs) terminology. in our study, we refer to trees that equal or exceed this value to be “large-trees” or “large-diameter trees.” extensive studies determined that the large tree component of old forest structure had decreased due to human uses, and that sensitive wildlife species associated with old growth forest such as the american marten and the northern goshawk were also in decline (interior columbia basin ecosystem management project, 2000; wisdom et al., 2000; bull et al., 2005; greenwald et al., 2005). site-specific exceptions have allowed removal of some trees ≥21 in dbh. however, the 21-inch rule has prevented large-scale harvest of trees ≥21 in dbh. for example, the 2010 snow basin vegetation management project proposed harvesting over 43,000 trees ≥21 in dbh but was stopped by litigation [league of wilderness defenders, et al., v. connaughton, et al., no. 3:12-cv-02271-hz (d. or. dec. 9, 2014)]. recently restoration of these forests was claimed to be inhibited by the 21-inch rule that protects large trees from logging (hessburg et al., 2020). the rationale for harvesting large trees is premised upon the use of historical baselines of stand structure and species composition as management targets, and assuming that by removing large shade-tolerant species like grand fir and douglas-fir it will promote resilience to future drought and disturbance (johnston et al., 2018; merschel et al., 2019; hessburg et al., 2020). however, ongoing climate change and many other anthropogenic stressors such as habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and declines in biodiversity, heighten concerns over use of historical conditions as management targets (millar et al., 2007; ipcc, 2018; ripple et al., 2020). proposed amendments to the 21-inch diameter limit would allow widespread harvesting of the larger trees up to 30 in dbh (76.2 cm) across six national forests of eastern oregon and southwestern washington with major implications for forest carbon dynamics and important environmental co-benefits (figure 1)., figure 1. locations of the six national forests in eastern oregon, southeastern washington, and western idaho, and the proposed snow basin project area (a). the forest carbon conservation priority rank is shown for the national forests and (b) for the broader western united states. the forest carbon conservation priority rank is from buotte et al. (2020) and was derived from simulations of potential forest carbon sequestration and vulnerability to drought and fire over the 21st century. forest extent is from ruefenacht et al. (2008)., carbon storage is an increasingly important management objective for national forest lands in the united states (depro et al., 2008; dilling et al., 2013; dugan et al., 2017). usfs forest inventory and analysis (fia) data have been used to develop baseline stocks and trends of forest carbon for every region and individual national forest, including assessment of the main disturbance, management, and environmental factors that drive changes (birdsey et al., 2019). western united states forests show considerable potential to accumulate additional carbon over the coming century, especially forests within the pnw that are projected to have relatively low to moderate vulnerability to future drought and fire (figure 1; buotte et al., 2020). strategies to mitigate climate change effects on forests require careful examination of the tradeoffs of proposed forestry practices on forest carbon stock accumulation, water cycling, and additional environmental co-benefits of forests, such as biodiversity and microclimatic buffering (mckinley et al., 2011; law et al., 2018; sheil, 2018; buotte et al., 2020)., the potential effects of changing the 21-inch rule on carbon storage of eastside forests have not been adequately considered. proposed changes to the management of large trees should be carefully assessed prior to adoption of new rules given that forest carbon storage is critically important in the context of a warming climate, and that large trees disproportionately store more accumulated carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere. the objective of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of removal of the 21-inch rule on forest carbon stocks and carbon stock accumulation in eastside forests (figure 1). we examine the relationship between tree dbh and agc storage at tree to population scales for selected dominant tree species in eastside forests, focusing on the following questions:, 1. how does agc storage change with tree diameter among the dominant eastside tree species?, 2. how common are large trees across the eastside forests by species and what proportion of each species total agc do they account for?, 3. what are the potential consequences on carbon stores of widespread removal of large trees in eastside forest restoration projects?, our study area included the six national forests in eastern oregon, two of which extend slightly into southwestern washington and western idaho (figure 1). located within the east cascades and blue mountains ecoregions, these national forests together cover approximately 11.5 million acres (4.7 million ha) of complex mountainous terrain, characterized by a broad range of environmental gradients in climate regimes and associated forest types (johnson and clausnitzer, 1992; peterson and waring, 1994; berner and law, 2015). the blue mountains ecoregion functions ecologically and floristically as a transverse bridge between the cascade mountains to the west and the rocky mountains to the east (kerns et al., 2017). this “mega-corridor” links together some of the most intact habitat remaining in the pnw region and is of great importance to regional-scale connectivity and carbon storage in response to a warming climate (mcguire et al., 2016; buotte et al., 2020)., climatic conditions from 1981 to 2019 were similar across national forests with regard to january and july average temperatures but show substantial variation in annual precipitation (table 1). the deschutes and fremont-winema national forests are in the eastern cascade mountains and thus receive relatively high annual precipitation (817 mm and 681 mm) due to orographic uplift. national forests in the southwestern blue mountains receive less precipitation (malheur, 571 mm; ochoco, 484 mm) due to their location within the rainshadow of the cascade mountains. in the northeastern portion of our study area annual precipitation increases to 802 mm and 792 mm, respectively, for the umatilla and wallowa whitman national forests due to the intrusion of moisture-laden air masses through the columbia river gorge. the region’s complex precipitation patterns are similarly reflected in the distribution of forest types and biophysical characteristics., table 1. summary of forest inventory data and climate conditions for the six national forests included in the analysis., we relied on forest inventory measurements from the usfs fia program and our own selection of biomass equations to evaluate relationships between tree diameter and agc storage, as well as assess potential effects of tree removal proposed as part of the 2010 snow basin project. the fia conducts systematic forest inventories across the united states, with one field sampling plot for every ∼2,400 hectares (6,000 acres) of forest (o’connell et al., 2017). in the western united states, the fia surveys 10% of sampling plots each year, meaning that each sampling plot is revisited every 10 years. at each sampling plot, field crews collect data on tree species, tree size, and other forest attributes. these inventory data are available online through the fia datamart1., we downloaded the latest fia data (fiadb_1.8.0.02) for oregon, washington, and idaho, and then identified inventory plots that occurred within the six national forests based on a spatial overlay with national forest boundaries (n = 3,973 plots). to maintain landowner privacy the fia plot coordinates available to the public are slightly altered (“fuzzed”), thus our spatial overlay may include some plots just outside the national forests or miss some plots that occur around the edges of these forests. we selected the latest inventory measurements from each surveyed plot for the years 2010 to 2018 (the most recent year available). we filtered these data to include only live trees of the five tree species of interest. a total of 54,651 individual trees were measured on the microplots, subplots, and macroplots, which represented 636,520 trees after applying the expansion factors for each type of plot. overall, we used data from 3,335 plots in this analysis. a summary of fia plot conditions within our study area shows that relatively small variations in average dbh across national forests, between 13 cm and 17 cm, translate into substantial differences in agc (table 1). the fremont winema national forest had the largest average dbh (∼17 cm) and the largest average agc stores (∼145 kg), whereas the wallowa-whitman had the smallest average dbh (∼13 cm) and the smallest average agc stores (∼91 kg)., we performed the analysis using the statistical software r (v. 3.6.1; r core team, 2020) with add-on packages including data.table (dawle and srinivasan, 2019), ggplot2 (wickham, 2016), maptools (bivand and lewin-koh, 2019), raster (hijmans, 2019), and rgdal (bivand et al., 2019)., we estimated agc storage (agc; kg c) for each tree on the fia inventory plots using tree biometric measurements from fia along with species- and component-specific biomass allometric models and traits (supplementary tables 1, 2). using species-specific allometric models that include height measurements are essential to capture climate and site effects on taper and height (volume), and reduce uncertainty compared to estimates that are diameter-based and generalized models. for example, van tuyl et al. (2005) found that generalized models underestimated biomass by 50% on the eastside. specifically, for each tree we estimated agc as the sum of carbon stored in stem, branch, bark, and foliage biomass. to estimate stem biomass, we first derived stem volume using species-specific allometric models that incorporated tree diameter and height (cochran, 1985; supplementary table 1). we then converted stem volume to biomass using published information on the wood density of each species, which we found was important to reducing uncertainty in estimates (van tuyl et al., 2005; ross, 2010; berner and law, 2015). we also estimated branch, bark, and foliage biomass using species-specific allometric models, substituting equations for similar species where necessary (gholz et al., 1979; means et al., 1994; jenkins et al., 2004). we assumed dry stem, branch, and bark biomass was 47.6 to 52.5% carbon depending on species (lamlom and savidge, 2003) and that dry foliage biomass was 46.1 to 51.4% carbon depending on species (berner and law, 2016). for trees smaller than 10 cm dbh, total aboveground biomass was estimated from tree height and then converted to agc assuming wood carbon content., to better understand how carbon storage varies with tree size in eastside forests, we examined relationships between tree diameter (dbh; cm) and aboveground carbon (agc; kg) among trees sampled on the fia plots. specifically, we rounded the dbh of each tree to the nearest centimeter and then computed the average agc of trees within each 1-cm size class. to account for sampling uncertainty, we repeatedly computed these metrics using a resampling approach where each draw (n = 104) utilized data from a random 25% of inventory plots sampled with replacement. we computed the median across these 104 draws as our best-estimate of these metrics and also derived 95% confidence intervals., we evaluated how the cumulative percentage of tree stems and agc varied with tree diameter across the six national forests of our study area using forest inventories. this involved quantifying the cumulative percentage of tree stems and total agc by dbh for each tree species, as well as pooled across tree species. to account for sampling uncertainty, we again implement a resampling approach (n = 104 draws)., to estimate the carbon consequences of large tree removal we utilized usfs national environmental policy act (nepa) documentation from the snow basin vegetation management project located on the wallowa-whitman national forest, whitman ranger district, baker county, oregon (figure 1). the project area includes 10,721 ha (26,493 acres) of national forest land and primarily encompasses two main subwatersheds (paddy creek-eagle creek and little eagle creek). elevations within the project area range from approximately 1,340 m (4,400 feet) on the southern boundary to approximately 1,980 m (6,500 feet) at the northern boundary near the border with the eagle cap wilderness. the usfs’s preferred alternative plan was to remove over 43,000 large trees (dbh ≥ 21 in or 53.3 cm) from the project area. the large tree removal was prevented by litigation, but the project nonetheless provides a realistic framework to evaluate the carbon cost of large tree removal associated with dry forest landscape-scale restoration projects., the snow basin nepa document estimated the number of large trees to be removed or retained per acre by biophysical environment (snow basin deis). the usfs’s preferred alternative proposed removal of grand fir from cool/moist and warm/dry grand fir biophysical environments, as well as removal of ponderosa pine, douglas-fir, and western larch from mixed ponderosa pine and douglas-fir biophysical environments (table 2). based on this information we computed the total number of large trees proposed for removal vs. retention across the project area by biophysical environment. to evaluate the potential carbon consequences of large tree removal, it was necessary to know tree size class distribution. the fia only surveyed 13 plots in the snow basin project area between 2010 and 2018, of which 12 plots included large trees. after an initial analysis, we deemed this inadequate for rigorous assessment of tree size class distribution and therefore used tree measurements from all fia plots in the wallowa-whitman national forest that included large trees for the species of interest (n = 217 plots). to estimate the size class distribution of large trees, we computed the fraction of large trees that occurred at 0.1 cm dbh intervals between 53.3 cm and the largest observed dbh for grand fir, and after combining ponderosa pine, douglas-fir, and western larch into a mixed-species group. for each biophysical environment, we then distributed the large trees proposed for removal or retention among these size classes in proportion to the occurrence of trees in each size class. lastly, we estimated the total large tree agc that would be removed or retained by multiplying the number of trees in each size class by the mean agc of trees in that size class and then summing agc across size classes. to account for sampling uncertainty, we again computed these metrics using a resampling approach where each of 104 draws utilized data from a random 25% of inventory plots sampled with replacement. as before, we computed the median across these 104 draws as our best-estimate and derived 95% confidence intervals. for verification, we also performed this assessment using only fia plots in the snow basin project area rather than across the wallowa-whitman national forest and present these findings in the supplementary material., table 2. the total number of trees ≥21 in dbh proposed for removal and retention across the snow basin project area as reported in the nepa plan prepared by the usfs (table 53 of snow basin vegetation management project deis, 2011)., average tree aboveground carbon (agc; kg) rapidly increased with tree diameter at breast height (dbh; cm) among dominant tree species measured on usfs inventory plots located in the six eastside national forests (figure 2). for instance, an average 25 cm (∼10”) diameter tree stored 90–121 kg of agc depending on tree species, while a 50 cm (∼20”) diameter tree stored 541–683 kg of agc. thus, doubling tree diameter over this range led to a 5.3–6.2-fold increase in agc. similarly, tripling tree diameter from 25 cm to 75 cm led to a 13.8–18.2-fold increase in agc, with the largest increase observed for ponderosa pine. for any given diameter, ponderosa pine, douglas-fir and western larch tended to store more agc than an engelmann spruce or grand fir., figure 2. average tree aboveground carbon (agc; kg) increases sharply with tree diameter at breast height (dbh; cm) for five dominant tree species measured on usfs inventory plots located in the six eastside national forests. the 21-inch (53.3 cm) dbh limit of the eastside screens (vertical dash line) is shown for reference. tree agc (≥10 cm dbh) was estimated from tree diameter and height using regional species-specific allometric equations, wood density, and carbon content. similarly, sapling agc (dbh = 3–9.9 cm) was estimated from sapling height using regional species-specific allometry and wood carbon content. these estimates and 95% confidence intervals were derived by resampling (n = 104) measurements from inventory plots (n = 3,335). for visual clarity, the tree diameter limit for each species excludes the largest 0.5% of trees, generally those larger than 80 to 88 cm dbh., these results clearly showed that for large trees, a small increase in diameter corresponds to a massive increase in additional carbon storage relative to a small tree increasing by the same diameter increment. overall, as trees grow larger, each additional centimeter of stem diameter corresponds with a progressively larger increase in tree carbon storage., large trees (dbh ≥ 21 in or 53.3 cm) accounted for a small percentage of each species’ tree stems, but a substantial percentage of the total agc stored by each species on fia inventory plots located in the six eastside national forests (figure 3 and table 3). specifically, large trees accounted for ∼2.0 to ∼3.7% of all stems (dbh ≥ 1” or 2.54 cm) among the five dominant tree species; however, these trees held ∼33.3 to ∼45.8% of the total agc stored by each species (table 3). grand fir had the lowest percentage of stems ≥21 in dbh (∼2.0%), while ponderosa pine and douglas-fir had the highest percentage of stems exceeding this threshold (both ∼3.7%). however, large grand fir trees accounted for 38.4% of total species agc, whereas large douglas-fir accounted for 37.5% of total species agc. western larch had the lowest percentage of total species agc in trees ≥21 in (∼33.3%), whereas ponderosa pine had the highest percentage (∼45.8%)., figure 3. percentage of (a) all tree stems and (b) total aboveground carbon that occur in trees above a given diameter threshold by species based on measurements from usfs inventory plots located in the six eastside national forests. the dashed vertical lines represent a 21 in (53.3 cm) tree dbh. these estimates and 95% confidence intervals were derived by resampling (n = 104) measurements from inventory plots (n = 3,335). for example, trees with ≥21 in diameter represent 3.7 [3.2, 4.2]% of all ponderosa pine and account for 45.8 [42.8, 48.8]% of all aboveground carbon stored by this species on these inventory plots. only ∼0.002% of trees exceeded 150 cm diameter, so for visual clarity we limited the x-axis to 150 cm., table 3. percentage of all trees stems and total aboveground carbon (agc) occurring in trees above and below the 21 in dbh threshold based on measurements from usfs inventory plots located in the six eastside national forests., pooling across the five dominant species, large trees accounted for ∼3.1% of the 636,520 trees occurring on the inventory plots, but stored ∼42.2% of the total agc. similarly, based on the fia’s crm method, the five tree species together accounted for 44.9% of total agc, with species-specific agc stores ranging from ∼36.5 to ∼49.3% of the total stored by each species (supplementary table 3 and supplementary figure 1)., a similar examination for trees >30 in dbh (76.2 cm) showed that among the five species, trees larger than 30 in dbh accounted for 0.4–0.9% of stems, but held ∼9.0 to ∼19.0% of each species agc (table 4). ponderosa pine had the highest percentage of stems >30 in dbh (∼0.9%) and accounted for the highest percentage of agc (∼19.4%) among the five species. douglas-fir had ∼0.6% of stems >30 in dbh, and these stems held ∼12.9% of total species agc. engelmann spruce, grand fir, and western larch each had ∼0.4% stems >30 in dbh, and accounted for ∼10.3, ∼14.0, and ∼9.2% of each species total agc, respectively. overall, trees >30 in dbh represent 0.6% of stems on inventory plots, but stored 16.6% of the total agc., table 4. percentage of all tree stems and total aboveground carbon (agc) occurring in trees above and below the 30 in diameter threshold based on measurements from usfs inventory plots located in the six eastside national forests., as per the usfs nepa documentation, the snow basin project preferred alternative would have removed ∼43,447 large trees (dbh ≥ 21 in or 53.3 cm) across 12,371 acres, while retaining ∼53,475 large trees over this area (table 2). we estimate this would translate into removing ∼131.3 gg agc stored in large trees, while retaining ∼164.1 gg agc in large trees (1 gg = 109 g; table 5). grand fir from cool-moist and warm-dry environments would together comprise ∼67% (∼87.3 gg c) of large tree agc removed by the project, while ponderosa pine, douglas-fir, and western larch from warm-dry and warm-moist environments would comprise the remaining ∼33% (∼43.8 gg c). the project would have the largest relative and absolute impact on grand fir occurring in warm-dry environments, where 50% (∼73.7 gg c) of large tree agc would be removed. we obtained similar results albeit with substantially wider confidence intervals using only fia inventory plots occurring in the snow basin project area (supplementary table 4)., table 5. removal and retention of aboveground carbon (agc) in large trees (dbh ≥ 21 in) within the proposed snow basin project area., our study reveals the large carbon stocks associated with large-diameter trees in the region, and the potential for significant losses in agc with large tree logging. the 21-inch rule was initially conceived to protect remaining late successional and old-growth forest and the native species that depend on these unique ecosystems for survival in forests east of the cascades crest in oregon and washington (henjum et al., 1994). the carbon storage associated with the 21-inch rule on the six national forests is a significant co-benefit of this protective measure. large trees (dbh ≥ 21 in or 53.3 cm) constitute ∼3% of the total stems, but store ∼42% (∼45% with crm; supplementary table 3) of the agc across the six eastside forests (table 3). this finding highlights the important role of large trees in storing carbon in eastside forest ecosystems, and is consistent with previous findings on the disproportionately important role of large trees in the forest carbon cycle (hudiburg et al., 2009; lutz et al., 2012, 2018; stephenson et al., 2014). the sharp increase in carbon storage with increasing tree diameter (figure 2) speaks to the importance of preserving mature and old large trees to keep this carbon stored in the forest ecosystem where it remains for centuries (law et al., 2018; lutz et al., 2018). once trees attain large stature, each additional dbh increment results in a significant addition to the tree’s total carbon stores, whereas small-diameter trees must effectively ramp up to size before the relationship between dbh and agc results in significant carbon gains. harvest of large-diameter trees, even focused on a specific species (e.g., grand fir) can remove upward of 50% of the large tree agc from these ecosystems (table 5)., there are substantial differences in wood density among the species examined that contributes to the observed differences in agc at a given dbh. wood density tends to be higher for ponderosa pine (∼0.45 g cm3), douglas-fir (∼0.52 g cm3), and western larch (∼0.56 g cm3) than for engelmann spruce (∼0.37 g cm3) or grand fir (∼0.40 g cm3; supplementary table 2). an evaluation of the relationship between tree height and diameter suggests the observed differences in agc are not driven by ponderosa pine, douglas-fir and western larch tending to be taller at a given dbh than engelmann spruce or grand fir. although stem decay is common in mature and old grand fir, a synthesis shows no evidence of carbon consequences of heart rot in grand fir (harmon et al., 2008). while we could not estimate heart rot loss in grand fir due to lack of sufficient data, heart rot respiration has been estimated for another species and it had a scant contribution to ecosystem respiration (harmon et al., 2004)., forestry practices exert significant controls on stand structure and forest carbon dynamics, and alterations of harvest practices can substantially alter carbon storage and accumulation (masek et al., 2011; turner et al., 2011; krankina et al., 2012; kauppi et al., 2015; law et al., 2018). generally, there is a negative relationship between harvest intensity and forest carbon stocks whereby as harvest intensity increases, forest carbon stocks decrease while emissions increase (hudiburg et al., 2009; mitchell et al., 2009; simard et al., 2020). it can take centuries to reaccumulate forest carbon stocks reduced by harvest (birdsey et al., 2006; mckinley et al., 2011). it would take 180 to 310 years to reach maximum biomass in the blue mountains and east cascades, respectively, after harvest of the large trees (hudiburg et al., 2009), too long to help reach climate mitigation targets in the next few decades. the amount of harvested carbon that remains stored in wood products is insufficient to offset the loss of carbon stored in the forest. if harvested, life cycle assessment shows that 65% of the wood harvested in oregon over the past 115 years has been emitted to the atmosphere, 16% is in landfills and only 19% remains in wood products (hudiburg et al., 2019). thus, harvesting the large trees will increase, not decrease emissions and end centuries of long-term carbon storage in the forests., the 21-inch rule has preserved the trees that store and accumulate a disproportionately large amount of carbon in these forests (figure 3 and table 3). of the ∼3% of tree stems over 21 in dbh in the study area, about 81% of these are between 21 in and 30 in dbh and account for ∼61% of the agc in all large trees (supplementary figure 2). trees over 30 inches dbh account for ∼19% of the large tree stems and hold ∼39% of agc in large trees. these findings are similar to those reported by stephenson et al. (2014) and emphasize the relative importance of the sub-30 in dbh large trees in the study area, and the value in allowing these trees to continue growing and replenish the stock of trees over 30 inches dbh that are rare on the landscape. this proforestation strategy is among the most rapid means for accumulating additional quantities of carbon in forests and out of the atmosphere (moomaw et al., 2019)., the importance of forest carbon storage is now greatly amplified by a warming climate that must urgently be addressed with reductions in greenhouse gasses and natural climate solutions (ipcc, 2018; ripple et al., 2020). the preponderance of forests in our study area have medium to high carbon accumulation potential and low future climatic vulnerability (figure 1), which reinforces the value of protecting large trees to help abate our current trajectory toward massive global change (fargione et al., 2018; buotte et al., 2020). rather than holding ecosystems to an idealized conception of the past using historical conditions as management targets, a good understanding of the environmental co-benefits associated with large tree protection is needed to inform management strategies that contribute toward solving humanity’s most pressing earth system challenges (millar et al., 2007; rockström et al., 2009; barnosky et al., 2017; ripple et al., 2020). replacing large diameter trees with seedlings will create a major carbon loss to the atmosphere during harvest (harris et al., 2016) and not achieve storage of comparable atmospheric carbon for the indefinite future., large grand fir trees (dbh ≥ 21 in or 53.3 cm) accounted for the lowest proportion of tree stems for the five species we evaluated (2%), possibly reflecting the ingrowth of young, small grand fir within portions of our study area (merschel et al., 2014; johnston et al., 2016). one of the main premises for the proposed removals of large-diameter grand fir trees is that they have increased over historic levels, especially in drier biophysical environments. however, our data does not indicate an uncharacteristic abundance of large grand fir trees across these forests. given the recent history of high-grade logging that focused on large and old trees (henjum et al., 1994; rainville et al., 2008), historical abundances of large trees were much greater than today (wales et al., 2007; hagmann et al., 2013; kauppi et al., 2015), and thus would have represented a larger fraction of aboveground biomass than currently found on these forests., interestingly, with respect to the overall representation of species abundance based on inventory plots (table 3), the population of grand fir with 187,445 stems is a distant second to ponderosa pine with 286,970 stems, followed by douglas-fir (100,021 stems), engelmann spruce (31,375 stems), and western larch (30,708 stems). to the extent that current forest stand structure is skewed toward smaller diameter classes, ponderosa pine, grand fir, and douglas-fir trees are notable for the number of trees on inventory plots., it is important to note that a diameter limit that emphasized protection of carbon stores would ideally protect trees starting at a lower dbh limit (∼12–15 inches). the 21-inch rule has provided significant leeway for fuels reduction and ecological restoration toward historical baselines to proceed in eastside forests. ecological restoration treatments generally recommend giving protection to large and old trees, while reducing surface and ladder fuels, and accompanied by understory thinning treatments where appropriate and reintroduction of low-intensity fire at intervals (allen et al., 2002; brown et al., 2004; agee and skinner, 2005; noss et al., 2006). from a forest carbon perspective, it would be prudent to restore an appropriate number of the approximately 97% of tree stems <21 inches dbh to replenish the stock of large trees over time (lutz et al., 2018; moomaw et al., 2019), while continuing to protect large trees for their carbon stores and the myriad other benefits that they provide. this approach would achieve the benefits of proforestation in the larger, most fire-resistant trees and reduction of fuel loads and stem density in the smaller diameter tree stems., the snow basin project provides a case study for how amending the 21-inch rule to allow logging large trees could change management across the six eastside national forests. overall the snow basin project would have removed 44% or 131,000 metric tons of carbon stored in large trees. this is equivalent to ∼0.75% of annual oregon statewide carbon emissions, and this does not include carbon in tree roots or the agc losses due to the removal of trees <21 in dbh. removing nearly half of the carbon content from the large trees over 12,000 acres would create a carbon deficit in the live, dead, and soil carbon pools that will persist for many decades to the end of the century. however, left standing, these 43,445 large trees continue to grow, sequestering more carbon into long-term stores (stephenson et al., 2014; law et al., 2018; domke et al., 2020). older trees (∼100 years) are the next generation of old growth and already possess qualities associated with large, old trees, such as large canopies, deep root systems, and thick, fire-resistant bark., high carbon conservation-priority forests support important components of biodiversity and are associated with increased water availability (mckinley et al., 2011; perry and jones, 2016; berner et al., 2017; law et al., 2018; buotte et al., 2020). large-diameter snags persist as standing snags for many years, providing valuable wildlife habitat, and account for a relatively high proportion of total snag biomass in temperate forests (lutz et al., 2012). in pnw forests, large hollow trees, both alive and dead, are the most valuable for denning, shelter, roosting, and hunting by a wide range of animals (bull et al., 2000; rose et al., 2001). in the interior columbia river basin, grand fir and western larch form the best hollow trees for wildlife uses (rose et al., 2001). downed hollow logs continue to serve as important hiding, denning, and foraging habitat on the forest floor (bull et al., 1997; bull et al., 2000). large decaying wood influences basic ecosystem processes such as soil development and productivity, nutrient immobilization and mineralization, and nitrogen fixation (harmon et al., 1986). continuing to protect large trees in eastside forests provides the greatest benefit for carbon, habitat, and biodiversity., water availability and microclimatic buffering are also disproportionately affected by large trees and intact forests (frey et al., 2016; buotte et al., 2020). forest canopies of the pnw buffer extremes of maximum temperature and vapor pressure deficit, with biologically beneficial consequences (davis et al., 2019a). removal of large trees quickly leads to a large increase in soil and canopy heating, which increases enough to impact photosynthesis (kim et al., 2016), seedling survival, and regeneration (kolb and robberecht, 1996; davis et al., 2019b). the climatic changes toward warmer and drier conditions expected in the next decades will likely increase forest stress and mortality (allen et al., 2015). eastside forests experienced hotter and drier conditions from 2003 to 2012 concentrated in the months of august and september, especially in drier forest type groups (i.e., ponderosa pine, juniper), whereas spring months (april–june) showed trends toward cooler and wetter conditions (mildrexler et al., 2016). projections suggest that proportionally, the largest changes in microclimatic buffering capacity will occur in lower elevation or dry forests, which currently have more limited buffering capacity (davis et al., 2019a). in these drier regions, microclimatic buffering by forest canopies may create important microsites and refugia in a moisture-limited system (meigs and krawchuk, 2018). in an old growth ponderosa pine stand in eastern oregon, ∼35% of the total daily water used from the upper 2 m was replaced by hydraulic redistribution from deep soil by deep-rooted larger trees in summer (brooks et al., 2002). the bigger trees rarely reach 80% loss of hydraulic conductivity, and both mature pine and mesic douglas-fir were better buffered from the effects of drought on photosynthesis compared with young pine (∼20-year old) due to full root development and larger stem capacitance in older trees (kwon et al., 2018). redistribution of deep soil water can increase seedling survival during summer drought when young trees lack the root development to reach deep soil water (brooks et al., 2002). while large tree composition may have shifted today relative to european settlement times, these large trees nonetheless continue to perform important functional attributes related to water and climate such as carbon storage, hydraulic redistribution, shielding the understory from direct solar radiation, and providing wildlife habitat. these functional attributes of large trees, irrespective of species, characterize ecosystems through thousands to millions of years (barnosky et al., 2017), and are not quickly replaced., in mesic forest environments, microclimatic buffering and transpirational cooling are amplified because sites with higher moisture availability are better able to shift energy to latent as opposed to sensible heat fluxes (dai et al., 1999; mildrexler et al., 2011). during midday in full sun the surface temperature of a closed canopy moist forest is warmer than the temperature beneath the canopy which is protected from direct solar radiation (thomas, 2011). microclimates in moist forests are strongly linked to their closed-canopy structure (chen et al., 1999; aussenac, 2000). removal of the overstory creates canopy openings that increase solar radiation penetration resulting in increased drying of the understory vegetation and the forest floor, and a thermal response of rising land surface temperatures (chen et al., 1993, 1999). this alteration in the subcanopy thermal regime changes atmospheric mixing between the ground, subcanopy, and canopy, which in turn modifies the microclimate condition of the affected stand. microclimate modifications associated with forest harvesting are expected to be greatest in moist forests and may affect resilience to climate change and increase the risk of occurrence and severity of wildfires (lindenmayer et al., 2009). maintaining mesic microclimates may give undisturbed moist forests and the species they support some inherent resilience to climate change. moreover, an evaluation of the effects of water limitations on forest carbon cycling in the eastern cascade mountains found that grand fir radial growth was not strongly associated with variability in temperature or water variability (berner and law, 2015). a lengthening of the growing season may increase productivity in high-elevation grand fir stands. the microclimatic buffering, current and future potential carbon stores, and intact nature of previously unlogged grand fir and douglas-fir forest types are co-benefits of protecting large trees that need to be considered in future management decisions., the consequences of reducing protection of large trees are significant reduction in forest carbon stores and their climate mitigation, impacts on habitat for animals including birds, and resilience to a changing climate for decades to centuries to come. given the rarity of large trees across the landscape, and their outsized role in storing carbon removed from the atmosphere, our findings call into question the value of removing large trees for forest modification in eastside forests., if the 21-inch rule were retained on these lands, continued protection of the existing carbon stock would prevent large quantities of harvest related biogenic carbon from being released to the atmosphere. it is also essential to let a sufficient number of sub-21 inch trees remain to become additional large, effective carbon stores, and assure that carbon accumulation continues in these forests. rather than weakening the 21-inch rule, we suggest strengthening this important measure and expanding large tree protections to other western united states public lands that have been adversely affected by a similar history of large-tree logging. protecting and growing more large trees is the most effective near-term option for accumulating more carbon out of the atmosphere, and will benefit other ecosystem services as well., some public lands (local, state, and federal) could become part of a designated reserve system that includes intact forest landscapes, and carbon rich forests, that hold most of these large, older trees. this is an appropriate use of public lands because the services they provide including biodiversity, water retention, carbon accumulation and storage, and regional cooling by evapotranspiration serve the public interest, and promote sustainable economies that benefit from land protection and restoration., the critical need to adapt to more wildfire in the west is congruent with protecting large-trees in fire-prone forests. older forests experience lower fire-severity compared with younger, intensively managed forests, even during extreme weather conditions (zald and dunn, 2018). a shift in policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable defense of the wildland–urban interface to developing fire-adapted communities is needed (schoennagel et al., 2017). improved fire and forest management is part of the solution, but the most effective changes in terms of protection of people and property, will be near homes and on private property. prioritizing federal fuel treatments around communities and creating better mechanisms for reducing fuels on private land can help reduce home loss and better protect communities (moritz et al., 2014; schoennagel et al., 2017). given the natural role of fire in the west, managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of severities will help reduce future wildfire threats and increase ecological benefits in many systems (schoennagel et al., 2017)., eastside forests are surrounded predominantly by rural communities. for production forests, lengthening the forest cycle will keep a larger amount of carbon in trees and soils rather than in the atmosphere (law et al., 2018). rather than coupling funding of forest restoration or community payments to logging large trees and disturbing older forests, new policies could be enacted that compensate rural communities for protecting large trees in older forests and some of the younger trees that will become large with their associated carbon stores. to implement such policies, the amount to be paid to a community needs to be marginally greater than the revenue earned from cutting these large trees and the older forests in which they are located. policies that provide compensation for setting aside reserves and individual trees with microhabitats are already in place in europe (european commission, 2015). because this service benefits society as a whole and is an irreplaceable part of the natural climate solutions framework urgently needed for climate stabilization, the payment funds should come from the treasury since all citizens benefit from carbon accumulation by these trees and forests. with over half of oregon’s forest east of the cascade mountains crest, these forests are key to the state’s climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation goals., conducting a quantitative assessment using empirical data has determined the large carbon stock that would be lost and the resulting climate consequences if these large trees are harvested. research indicates that 2021 begins a pivotal decade for humanity to transition off of fossil-fuels (ipcc, 2018) and move “to achieve … stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” (unfccc, 1992, article 2). to meet net-zero carbon goals by 2050, it is estimated that reductions in net carbon emissions must be 7.6% per year over the decade of the 2020s (unep, 2019). this is most readily accomplished by reducing fossil fuel, bioenergy and industrial carbon dioxide emissions while simultaneously accumulating more carbon dioxide by protecting existing older forests that contain the largest share of carbon, and by allowing more forests to continue to accumulate carbon through proforestation (iucn, 2020). proforestation allows existing forests to continue growing without harvest or other management practices so that more trees can reach the large tree size that accumulates more carbon in the near and long term than do reforestation and afforestation (moomaw et al., 2019). no additional land is required as is the case with afforestation, and proforestation is the lowest cost opportunity for reaching the zero net carbon goal by 2050. in fire-prone forests such as in our study area, a diameter limit strikes the balance between protecting the most fire-resistant trees that store the most carbon and allowing fuels reduction with reintroduction of fire in dry biophysical environments. intact mesic forests are ideal locations for proforestation. harvesting large trees will add very large amounts of biogenic carbon to the atmosphere (harris et al., 2016), and make the net zero carbon goal difficult or impossible for oregon to achieve. the young trees will never be able to recover and accumulate the amount of carbon that is in the growing and older forests during these next critical decades, and will only equal current levels a century or more from now., protecting large trees to help stabilize climate is critically important for managing forest ecosystems as social-ecological systems. knowledge of the disproportionately large amount of carbon stored in a small fraction of trees creates an opportunity to engage the public, decision makers, and forest managers in their importance as an integral part of the climate solution., publicly available datasets were analyzed in

viral videos and top stories from MailOnline, Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers.', '[twenty five years after the princess\'s tragic, unexpected death, the formidable tina brown, author of the explosive diana chronicles, which was an early naughties sensation, has returned to the fray. her new book, the palace papers: inside the house of windsor - the truth and the turmoil, examines how that quest to ensure the monarchy is not simply a platform for family members to seek public acclaim has turned out. even a cursory look at the royal landscape would suggest things have not gone entirely to plan. while no conventional royal historian, brown tackles her subjects with the same brio she brought to her years as a highly regarded magazine editor, first with tatler, then with vanity fair and the new yorker. her access to those who flit around the royals gives her writing an edgy authenticity. the book, she says, is the result of two years\' work - and impeccable sources. \'i talked to more than 120 people, many of whom have been intimately involved with the senior royals and their households during the turbulent years since diana died,\' she explained. the result is a tour d\'horizon of the recent travails of the royal family, which is both critical of and surprisingly sympathetic to the figure at the heart of the story: the 96-year-old queen, whose head-in-the-sand approach or \'ostriching\' she often mocks., hamid karimi, 34 from iran, pictured, who is currently in calais, said if the uk government starts transporting asylum seekers to rwanda,

jumper, were taken as usual by his mother, the duchess of cambridge, earlier this month. keen photographer kate, 40, always knows how to get the best out of her children and the smile on her youngest child\'s face shows that louis is growing up to be a happy and contended little boy., prince harry might come back to the uk with his children for the queen\'s jubilee after being \'reassured\' about

competition in the hague., the duke of sussex wore a black hat with the white letters \'a\' and \'w\' to help publicise the charitable organisation he runs with wife meghan markle when he visited a bar in the hague for a pint last night., the duke of sussex founded the invictus games to aid the rehabilitation of injured or sick military personnel and veterans from across the globe, by giving them the challenge of competing in sporting events similar to the paralympics. harry spoke of his pride in the competitors sitting before him and told the audience: \'you have all summited your mountain. and i could not be prouder of every single one of you.\' harry said he is \'honoured\' to have served alongside \'all of you here tonight\', adding: \'thank you for your service and we\'ll see you in dusseldorf.\' it comes after he hailed the quality of the invictus games and its competitors saying it is \'way better\' than he \'ever imagined\'. the duke of sussex spoke to tv presenter jj chalmers on the final day of the 2020 games in the hague, which were delayed for two years until the past week due to the pandemic., speaking to people magazine, the duke of sussex said that he\'s \'grateful\' for his military experience, and will tell his children that \'finding your purpose is one of the most gratifying experiences\'., wearing one of her signature headscarves, her majesty,

\'so happy i\'ll see you next month my friend.\', things got off to a smooth start as the earl and countess of wessex exchanged gifts with the prime minister of the island yesterday, days after the grenada leg of their trip was postponed at the 11th hour. it marked the beginning of their seven-day tour of the caribbean where they are also scheduled to visit two other nations, antigua and barbuda and saint vincent and the grenadines. the platinum jubilee tour was organised to mark the queen\'s 70-year reign, and it comes shortly after the duke and duchess of cambridge were criticised for some elements of their recent caribbean tour, deemed to hark back to colonial days. sophie and edward presented prime minister philip pierre with a photograph of themselves and a jubilee box as a \'token of appreciation\' when they met him at his residence on friday evening. in return, saint lucia\'s pm gave the pair a painting of one of the island\'s turtles rolled up in a long black tube, and before discovering what the gift inside the tube was, edward joked: \'it\'s not a fishing rod.\' the couple then signed the guest book to complete their first day of engagements., it comes after a recent interim report by hilary cass, former president royal college of paediatrics and child health, into treatment of children with gender identify issues., andrew neil: it is commonplace to observe that starmer is no blair. he is wooden where blair was relaxed, dull where blair was exciting, hesitant where blair was fluent., brexit opportunity minister jacob rees mogg, pictured, has been touring

problems with trump.\', juliet laurie, 63, a retired science teacher from dorset, had always loved hill-walking with her husband and walking holidays with friends, but had started finding it harder to walk as far., in a statement which has raised concerns in chișinău, deputy commander of russia\'s central military district, rustam minnekayev, said russia planned to forge a corridor between crimea, the black sea peninsula (pictured right and inset: russian troops in mariupol) which russia annexed in 2014, and the donbas in eastern ukraine (pictured left: a map showing the russian advance). he also hinted russia\'s forces could move further west into transnistria - internationally recognised as moldova - in order to protect \'oppressed\' russia speakers. but last night moldova said the statements were \'unfounded\' and that the country remained a \'neutral state\'. \'these statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the russian federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of moldova,\' said moldova\'s foreign ministry on its website. \'during the meeting, it was reiterated that the republic of moldova ... is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the russian federation.\' the suggestion by a senior russian official that moscow needs to defend supporters in a nearby country is a chilling echo of its previous justification for invading ukraine. it would mean an extended war to the west of annexed crimea, where putin\'s sea power is diminished after the sinking of the moskva., mark galeotti: he will not tolerate dissent or any opinion that contradicts his own. but around him in moscow\'s halls of power, there is increasing disquiet., emmanuel macron reportedly fumed after seeing reports of boris johnson\'s visit to kyiv. he is said to have ranted to advisers: \'he hasn\'t actually done very much since the start of this.\', the british putin stooge who

explanation for the contradicting reports., speaking during a news conference in new delhi, the prime minister today said the government was contemplating sending tanks to poland., vladimir putin\'s (left) poor posture during the meeting and his bloated face and neck sparked speculation about the russian leader\'s health, which has reportedly been in decline since the ukraine invasion. in a rare

videos from MailOnline and the Daily Mail.', '[twenty five years after the princess\'s tragic, unexpected death, the formidable tina brown, author of the explosive diana chronicles, which was an early naughties sensation, has returned to the fray. her new book, the palace papers: inside the house of windsor - the truth and the turmoil, examines how that quest to ensure the monarchy is not simply a platform for family members to seek public acclaim has turned out. even a cursory look at the royal landscape would suggest things have not gone entirely to plan. while no conventional royal historian, brown tackles her subjects with the same brio she brought to her years as a highly regarded magazine editor, first with tatler, then with vanity fair and the new yorker. her access to those who flit around the royals gives her writing an edgy authenticity. the book, she says, is the result of two years\' work - and impeccable sources. \'i talked to more than 120 people, many of whom have been intimately involved with the senior royals and their households during the turbulent years since diana died,\' she explained. the result is a tour d\'horizon of the recent travails of the royal family, which is both critical of and surprisingly sympathetic to the figure at the heart of the story: the 96-year-old queen, whose head-in-the-sand approach or \'ostriching\' she often mocks., hamid karimi, 34 from iran, pictured, who is currently in calais, said if the uk government starts transporting asylum seekers to rwanda, he will remain in france. home secretary priti patel, inset, flew to

summer. a series of delightful images of the fifth in line to the throne, dressed casually in shorts and a grey wool star-print jumper, were taken as usual by his mother, the duchess of cambridge, earlier this month. keen photographer kate, 40, always knows how to get the best out of her children and the smile on her youngest child\'s face shows that louis is growing up to be a happy and contended little boy., prince harry might come back to the uk with his children for the queen\'s jubilee after being \'reassured\' about arrangements for their security., the duke of sussex said the

wearing archewell merchandise for the first time after he was seen sporting a baseball cap branded with the foundation\'s logo during a night out at a pub during the invictus games. the duke of sussex wore a black hat with the white letters \'a\' and \'w\' to help publicise the charitable organisation he runs with wife meghan markle when he visited the bar in the hague for a pint of guinness last night. and harry, 37, promoted archewell by wearing the cap while enjoying a pint of stout at o\'casey\'s irish bar, which other drinkers suggested he may have drunk as a toast to the queen on her 96th birthday yesterday. neither harry nor meghan have previously been seen wearing any merchandise with the archewell logo, and this will raise questions over whether a whole range of products could be released to help fund the charity. there has been no suggestion that there will be any kind of merchandise outlet for archewell either online or physically, although fans have already been suggesting that they would be interested in buying the cap. one social media user said: \'i\'m going to need that archewell hat, haz\'; while another tweeted: \'is it just me or is that an archewell cap on harry\'s head\'; and a third added: \'peep the archewell logo on the hat.\' the name \'archewell\' originates from the greek word \'arche\', meaning source of action, which also inspired the name of the couple\'s son archie harrison mountbatten-windsor who turns three in a fortnight\'s time on may 6., with meghan back home in california, harry took the opportunity to pop into an irish bar for a pint of guinness in the hague last night surrounded by five bodyguards, including four men usually protecting the dutch royals. harry expressed his delight when he took his first sip of the pint of world famous stout at o\'casey\'s irish bar, where other drinkers suggested there may have been a toast to the queen on her 96th birthday yesterday. the duke of sussex sat in a secluded part of the large beer garden with members of his invictus games staff and a couple of friends who flown from the uk to join in the pub visit. among them appears to be former strictly come dancing star jj chalmers, who was injured in a bomb blast in 2011 while serving as a royal marine in afghanistan. the prince - who sparked controversy this week when he spoke of how he is looking out for his

can be heard saying: \'i think there are real problems with trump.\' alongside the footage shared on twitter, piers (bottom right) branded the gb news host a \'treacherous, disingenuous little snake\'. it is unclear where or when the footage was taken, however farage\'s references to hilary clinton and his remark that \'it looks like trump\'s going to win\' suggest the video was recorded during the 2016 presidential election. during the clip, one audience member also references trump\'s opinions on abortion saying \'i will never be able to vote for an idiot like that,\' as farage responds: \'there are real problems with trump.\' it comes after trump (top right) released an audio recording that seemingly refuted an edited video clip that appeared to show him storming out of a

kremlin insiders fear putin\'s invasion of ukraine was a \'catastrophic\' mistake which could \'doom\' russia to years of isolation. chillingly, they warn he might well resort to the use of tactical nuclear weapons. such criticism is coming from both flanks, from the nationalists and the more socially liberal technocrats - from the hawks and doves, uniforms and suits., justin welby this week criticised government plans for asylum seekers who cross the channel in small boats to be sent to rwanda, describing it as \'ungodly\'. in 2016, welby invited a family of six fleeing terror in syria to live in a cottage on the grounds of lambeth palace, right. the family said they are now struggling in a flat in streatham, south london., irayna coleman-green (pictured inset with her children), 47, took to facebook to share the \'disappointing lunch\' she had with family in aldenham, hertfordshire on monday. she added that the salad - which came alongside the monster sausage in a three-inch roll (pictured) - consisted of just a few slices of raw carrot and cucumber, without any lettuce. toby carvery aldenham has apologised to the customer and said it was disappointed the meal \'doesn\'t reflect their high standards on this occasion\'. ms coleman-green said that while she and her husband filled up on their plates from the carvery, her 14-year-old son oscar was left confused about how to eat his disproportionate meal, with the sausage dangling off the sides of the bun. the unsatisfied diner said that when she quizzed the waitress about her son\'s meal, the server checked with the chef and claimed she was told that that\'s \'how it\'s usually served\'., june nelson: the year my husband bryan and i spent on an uninhabited galapagos island studying the booby bird was not part of an official expedition. there were no other members, and no medic, either. for medical emergencies we had only the do-it-yourself instructions scribbled by a doctor friend, in case of appendicitis: \'try, in this order: fasting, penicillin, prayer. if these fail, stick a knife into the tenderest spot as far as it will go.\' thankfully we never had to put those into practice. but by the time our year was almost over we had given up wearing clothes and our food was down to the weevil-infested bare minimum., reacting to the verdict, his mother ruth neave, 53, said she \'hated\' watson but admitted she regretted being on drugs when rikki was killed. she told the bbc: \'i feel flabbergasted and overwhelmed and they have got the right verdict because i know he done it. hate as well, because i hate him. because he got off with it for 27 years. i just hate him. the way he displayed his emotions, and i\'m glad he got convicted because i know he done it. this should have happened 27 years ago and they should have got it right. because i was never allowed to go out when i was a kid, i was stuck inside, so i give him [rikki] extra [freedom]. but what i do regret, is being on drugs as well. i was only on it for a year. one year everybody, one year.\' her quotes came as her daughter rochelle said she still holds their mother - who beat and neglected rikki - accountable for his death. she said: \'even though she didn\'t strangle him, she still let a six-year-old on the streets alone and she neglected him. all she was interested in was drugs and men and drink.\' yesterday\'s decision comes 26 years after rikki\'s mother ruth was cleared of her son\'s murder by a jury at northampton crown court following a high-profile 16-day trial., narelle guthrie, 35, from wiltshire

others were rescued and offered no explanation for the contradicting reports. shortly after the episode, the ministry said the entire crew of the ship, which was presumed by the media to be about 500 people, had been rescued. the loss of the guided missile cruiser - the flagship of russia\'s black fleet - was a humiliating setback for moscow. russia on friday did not acknowledge an attack on the

mezzanine, innovations in health information from the director of the national library of medicine, guest post by stephen sherry, phd, acting director of the national library of medicine’s national center for biotechnology information (ncbi), and bart trawick, phd, director of the ncbi customer services division., a little over two years ago, america woke to the emerging sars-cov-2 pandemic that would alter everyone’s perception of ‘normal’ in the months and years to follow. from the start, nlm’s technological infrastructure quickly bridged the gap between resources and action to support efforts to study, understand, and develop a plan of action to deal with the deadly virus that has claimed the lives of more than 6 million people worldwide according to the world health organization covid-19 dashboard. nlm has worked throughout the pandemic to provide timely data and develop digital resources to help combat this global crisis., nlm’s covid-19 resources, to assist in understanding the most fundamental questions surrounding the virus, nlm provides coronavirus-related tools and services centered around genetic information, literature, and clinical research protocols., sars-cov-2 gene sequences in genbank, in january 2020, nlm released the first complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) genome to the public through our genbank database, the world’s largest database of publicly available genetic sequences. it’s a significant scientific community accomplishment to release a fully annotated viral genome within a month of its detection in a human population and nlm is proud to have played a role in this. this information was essential to scientists – because only with the genetic sequence could they begin to determine the specific properties of the virus and its evolutionary relationship to other viruses., creating a lens to information, an immediate challenge during the early months of the pandemic was the lack of a standardized vocabulary for talking about the virus and the disease it caused, covid-19. this made searching the biomedical literature for coronavirus information difficult. to address this issue, nlm developed the litcovid tool, which provided researchers with a current and curated literature hub for coronavirus information. its handy classification system makes it easy for users to find the type of information they are interested in (e.g., “mechanism” or “treatment”). to further expand the application of this tool, nlm incorporated it into the pubmed clinical queries search interface., bringing covid-19 information to your fingertips, one of nlm’s biggest challenges amid the demand for covid-19 information has been organizing all the data, tools, and resources related to sars-cov-2 and covid-19. to date, there are over 3 million sars-cov-2–related sequencing experiments in nlm’s sequence read archive (sra), the world’s largest publicly available repository of high-throughput genetic sequencing data; 4 million sars-cov-2 sequences in genbank; more than 7,500 registered coronavirus clinical trials in nlm’s clinicaltrials.gov, the world’s largest clinical trial registry and results database; and 285,000 covid-19 articles in pubmed central (pmc), nlm’s digital archive of nearly 8 million freely accessible, full-text biomedical and life sciences journal articles. to organize and make this wealth of information findable, we created the ncbi sars-cov-2 resources page and regularly update the nlm homepage with news and information to guide users to relevant information., information when you need it most, patients and their families also need access to up-to-date, reliable information, and our medlineplus web resource added a covid-19 page to address this. for people seeking information on clinical studies related to covid-19, our clinicaltrials.gov resource provides this, along with a dedicated page that breaks down all covid-19 studies by funding source., nlm answers the call for access to covid-19 publications, nlm answered the call from the white house office of science and technology policy and science policy leaders of other nations by collaborating with publishers and scholarly societies to provide free and immediate public access to all coronavirus-related publications and associated data via pubmed central (pmc) as part of its public health emergency covid-19 initiative., this initiative also enabled artificial intelligence researchers to contribute to the covid-19 response effort by making more than 200,000 full-text articles available in formats and under license terms that enabled computational analysis as part of efforts such as the covid-19 open research dataset (cord-19) challenge and text retrieval conference (trec) covid challenge.  these global challenges aimed to improve and apply natural language processing and other ai techniques to coronavirus literature in an effort to generate new insights into the disease., reaching more people in more ways, as the nation’s archive for biotechnology information, we rely upon scientists to freely share data with us so that others may benefit. to assist submitters in getting this data into our sequence archives, we quickly worked to automate and simplify submissions, expedite data analysis, and prioritize data release to within minutes of submission. nlm investments ensured that database management work continues to scale in tandem with increased submission rates., none of this work would have been possible without the support of nih leadership and the efforts of nlm staff who accomplished great feats during a time of transition to remote work. we will apply the lessons learned during this period to serve the continuing needs of our community as the biology continues to evolve around us., as ncbi acting director, dr. sherry plans, directs, and manages the research, development, and technical operations of the national center for biotechnology information. he has 25 years of experience performing research, education, and data resource management involving human variation, genetics, and genomics. dr. sherry is a graduate of the pennsylvania

developer platform team, , since the launch of the google assistant, our developer ecosystem has been instrumental in delivering compelling voice experiences to more than 500 million active users. today, we’re taking a major step forward in helping you build these custom voice apps and services by introducing a suite of new and improved developer tools: actions builder and actions sdk. these tools make building conversational actions for the assistant easier and more streamlined than ever., actions builder is a web-based ide that lets you develop, test, and deploy directly in the actions console. the graphical interface lets you visualize the conversational flow, manage natural language understanding (nlu) training data, and debug with advanced tools., for those of you who prefer local ides, the updated actions sdk provides a file based representation of your actions project. this lets you author nlu training data and conversational flows locally as well as bulk import and export training data. we\'ve also updated the cli that accompanies actions sdk, so you can build and manage actions projects completely with code, using your favorite source control and continuous integration tools., together, actions builder and actions sdk create a seamless, consolidated development experience. no matter what tool you start with, you can switch between them based on what works best for your workflow. for example, you can use actions builder to lay out conversational flows and provide nlu training data, actions sdk to write fulfillment code, and the cli to synchronize the two. these tools create an environment where all team members can contribute effectively and focus on what they do best: design and code., a new, powerful interaction model lets you design conversations quickly and efficiently. intents and scenes let you define robust nlu training data and behavior for specific conversational contexts. using scenes as building blocks, you define active intents, declare context specific error handling, collect data through slot filling, and respond with prompts., scenes also separate conversational flow definitions from fulfillment logic, so you can reuse the same flows across multiple conversations. transitions between scenes let you define when one conversational context switches to another. all your scenes and transitions describe a full conversational flow and all possible dialog turns., you can express the entire interaction model with either the actions builder or actions sdk. a typical way to develop is to use actions builder to view and edit your scenes and then use actions sdk to sync changes to your local file system. this lets you version control your project, modify your project files, and build fulfillment in your favorite development environment., under the hood, we also made a lot of improvements that your users will appreciate. we sped up the assistant runtime engine, so users get faster responses and a smoother experience. we’ve also made the runtime engine smarter, so your actions can understand users better with the same amount of training data., we\'ve worked with pretzel labs and galinha pintadinha to test the capabilities of the new platform and to refine the interaction model and runtime engine improvements., pretzel labs built kids court with actions builder, creating a full conversational flow with no code and added fulfilment for advanced functionality., \"having the combination of a visual layout with webhook blocks for code helps us collaborate clearly and more efficiently. something i liked very much about this was the separation between the designer and the developers\' parts, making it very intuitive to make design changes without affecting backend logic.\" -- adva levin, founder of pretzel labs, galinha pintadinha runs one of the biggest youtube channels and built one the most popular conversational actions in their country. their development team migrated to the new platform to optimize their workflow and simplify future action development. galinha pintadinha’s actions now contain half the number of intents and have a radically simplified

It contains well written, well thought and well explained computer science and programming articles, quizzes and practice/competitive programming/company interview Questions.', '[as the placement season is back, geeksforgeeks is here to help you crack the interview. we have selected some most commonly asked and must do practice problems to crack product-based company interviews., you can also take part in our mock placement contests which will help you learn different topics and practice at the same time, simulating the feeling of a real placement test environment., , note: now you can track your progress and learn from video editorials of these questions must do interview preparation course., topic:,  , an array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. the idea is to store multiple items of the same type together., a matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. it is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets., strings are defined as an array of characters. the difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’., a linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations., a stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top. a stack follows the lifo (last in first out) principle., a queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the other side called the front. the queue data structure follows the fifo (first in first out) principle., a heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree., a tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child., binary search tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:, a graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. the nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph., trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. using trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length)., greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit., dynamic programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using dynamic programming., the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function., backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree)., you may also check our latest online course series to learn ds & algo is named dsa, which covers everything about data structures from basic to advanced., note:, an enriching course designed by the experts to help you crack the coding interview of top product or service-based

(emma lee/whyy), ask us about covid-19: what questions do you have about the coronavirus and vaccines?, this is one of a series of articles in which reporters from whyy’s health desk help desk answer questions about vaccines and covid-19 submitted by you, our audience., kids between the ages of 12 and 15 are now eligible to get the pfizer covid-19 booster, and children ages 5 to 11 can get a third dose of the vaccine if they’re immunocompromised. the centers for disease control and prevention approved the shots earlier this month., how much demand there will be for pediatric boosters is yet to be seen, however. children are among the most unvaccinated people in the united states, along with young adults., in pennsylvania excluding philadelphia, which is a separate vaccine jurisdiction, about 24% of 5- to 9-year-olds, more than 38% of 10- to 14-year-olds, and more than 54% of 15- to 19-year-olds have had at least one dose of the vaccine. in philadelphia, about 30% of 5- to 11-year-olds and about 56% of 12- to 17-year-olds have had at least one dose., in delaware, more than 61% of 12- to 17-year-olds and more than 25% of 5- to 11-year-olds have received at least one dose of the vaccine. and in new jersey, more than 31% of 5- to 11-year-olds and more than 63% of 12- to 15-year-olds have had at least one dose., how should we be using at-home rapid tests for omicron?, , recent research indicates these nasal swab tests may be less sensitive to the coronavirus’ omicron variant in the earliest days of infection., , 3 months ago, boosters are important, physicians in this region say, but it’s more pressing to get unvaccinated kids vaccinated. the current vaccination rate falls too short of what’s needed to protect children, doctors say., “i was on inpatient a couple of weeks ago … and every single kid i had who had covid was unvaccinated — some of them because they were too young, but some of them were older and could have been vaccinated, but their parents chose not to, and they either were coming in with covid, respiratory problems like pneumonia, or the multisystem inflammatory disease some weeks after having had covid and were seriously ill,” said dr. jonathan miller, medical director of value-based care and chief of primary care at nemours children’s health in the delaware valley., “and most of those families afterwards were going to go get their kids vaccinated,” he said. “so sort of the experience of living through the reality of what it can do to you quickly changes people’s minds, and i wish we could get to that before something like that happens.”, dr. paul offit, director of the vaccine education center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at children’s hospital of philadelphia, said the conversation should be around getting kids vaccinated in the first place. chop too, is seeing hospitalizations for covid-19 among unvaccinated children, he said., “we’re not going to boost our way out of this pandemic. we’re not going to test our way out of this pandemic. the only way out of this pandemic is vaccination … until we figure out how to get young people, including children vaccinated, we are going to continue to suffer this pandemic, at least on [an] every winter basis,” offit said., “when the virus first came into this country in january of 2020, the mantra was that children get infected less frequently, and when they’re infected, they’re connected less severely. that’s true. but that doesn’t mean that children can’t be infected and be severely infected. and that’s what we’re seeing now, because they’re a susceptible group, because they’re an under-vaccinated group, or unvaccinated group, as compared to our older citizens,” offit said., “you’re now seeing a virus like this, omicron, select them out. and so now we’re seeing hospitals that are in many ways overwhelmed with children who suffer this disease. they don’t have to suffer it,” he said. “there are vaccines available for those over 5, and a choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. it’s just a choice to take a different and more serious risk. so please get your children vaccinated.”, if your kids already are vaccinated, however, you may have some questions about what the recent cdc recommendation means. here’s what you need to know about the pediatric booster., kids between 12 and 15 who have received two doses of the pediatric pfizer covid-19 vaccine are eligible for a booster. that’s because in people of all ages the immunity conferred by vaccines wanes over time. the currently available covid vaccines, while they do still protect against serious illness, are less effective at preventing mild illness against omicron compared to other coronavirus variants., children ages 5 to 11 who are immunocompromised and have had two doses of the pfizer vaccine are eligible for a third dose. an additional dose is different from a booster. data shows many immunocompromised people do not produce sufficient antibodies even after the first two doses. however, studies show antibodies do increase after getting an additional dose., is a second vaccine booster in our future?, , get your first booster if you haven’t already, the experts say. whyy’s health desk help desk asked some of them what we know about additional shots., , 4 months ago, the pfizer booster for kids 12 and up is the same dosage as the first two shots. the dosage for 5- to 11-year-olds is one-third that given to older kids and adults., adolescents 12 and older can get their booster five months after their second dose. immunocompromised kids 5 and older can get their third dose at least 28 days after their second dose., data from 6,300 12- to 15-year-olds in israel who received boosters showed no cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, or pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike tissue surrounding the heart. the rare adverse event had been reported among some, mostly boys and young men, following the second dose of the mrna vaccine., “this happens extremely rarely. in fact, heart disease and myocarditis from getting covid disease is far more likely than myocarditis related to the vaccine,” miller said. “also, the myocarditis related to the vaccine tends to be very mild and short-lived.”, if your child has heart disease, or developed myocarditis following the first two doses of the vaccine, miller recommends talking to their cardiologists before getting the booster., he added that there’s no recommended vaccine for children that has long-term consequences., “if what we want from these vaccines is protection against serious illness — meaning the kind of illness that causes you to go to a doctor, or go to the hospital, or go to the intensive care unit — then two doses of the mrna does that,” offit said. “what a booster provides for the child is an additional three months of protection against mild illness.”, he said the problem with the omicron variant “is that even if you’ve been fully vaccinated, you still are at somewhat higher risk of having a mild illness than, say, if you were exposed to delta … so the advantage, then, of getting a booster dose is it does offer a few months’ worth of protection while omicron is circulating.”, some health experts are predicting omicron will cease to be an issue by february., getting a booster is advisable for children who have health conditions that put them at high risk of serious covid-19 illness, such as obesity, chronic lung disease, and chronic heart disease, offit said. and a third dose for kids over 5 who are immunocompromised is advised., “then it’s of value … to get a booster dose, which i think should be reassuring to parents that it is as safe as getting those first two doses. it provides additional protection against serious illness in those children,” he said., for healthy kids, miller said he still would recommend the booster. the omicron variant of the virus appears to cause more substantial health problems among children — either because more kids are getting infected or because the mutation is causing more respiratory symptoms., “for kids who got their vaccine in the late spring or early summer, their immunity is probably waning at this point. they don’t have as many antibodies as they did soon after the vaccine, and the booster can help their body build up more immunity and prepare them in case they end up being exposed to the virus,” miller said., boosters also protect other people around your children, he said., “you may have some high-risk people around you — older family members, neighbors, or other children who have high-risk conditions or problems with their immune system, or they’re just under 5, so they’re not old enough to get the vaccine yet,” miller said. “and so having kids who are appropriately boosted will help protect all those groups as well.”, he added that boosters could also prevent covid-19 outbreaks in settings such as sport teams, and help keep kids in school and in their extracurricular activities., saturdays just got more interesting., busy week? our weekend newsletter will catch you up on the best local stories of the

— suddenly phase-change his solid body into a gas. or, when he needed it, become a liquid., metamorpho is fictional. but phase-change is very real. water goes through a phase-change when it freezes or evaporates. in each case, it’s the same molecule — just in different chemical phases. the removal or addition of heat triggers the change between phases. imagine ice cubes melting into a glass of water. the ice absorbs the water’s heat. that warms up the ice, but cools down the water., phase-change cloth also works by moving heat around. the chinese team trapped a phase-changing polymer inside the fabric. it changes between a crystal and a non-crystal form. becoming a crystal absorbs — or removes — body heat. that will cool you down. but this heat isn’t gone. the fabric stores it. and the polymer will release that heat when it shifts back into a non-crystal. this now warms you up., the new fabric contains a novel mix of ingredients. in developing it, says yongyi zhang, “for the first time we demonstrate a scalable and controllable 3-d printing strategy.” zhang studies nanotechnology at the chinese academy of sciences in suzhou., his team described its innovative fabric in the january 31 acs applied materials & interfaces., the new fabric’s polymer will change its shape at different temperatures. that’s the phase-change part. in the non-crystal phase, “the polymer chains can move around each other,” notes emily pentzer, who did not take part in the new work. this polymer re-crystallizes again as it cools, the polymer scientist explains. pentzer works at texas a&m university in college station., the chinese team 3-d printed its fabric using an “ink” made from a mix of the new polymer and carbon nanotubes.  as their name implies, each of those tubes was only a few billionths of a meter in length. x-ray diffraction — an imaging tool that reveals the arrangement of individual molecules — shows that the polymers change from their messy non-crystal phase at warm temperatures to an orderly crystal phase when they’re cooler. this phase changes occur between 40º and 55º celsius (104º and 131º fahrenheit). changing the polymer’s chemical recipe could allow it to change phases at different temperatures., the new fabric performed well, zhang says — better than his team had expected. even after being folded 2,000 times, it worked as it was designed to do., but granados-focil at clark university points out that the team never made a side-by-side comparison of the fabric’s durability with and without its phase-change component. he’d like to see such a comparison., the chinese team added nanotubes to the fabric to help it conduct electricity. nanotubes also speed up the cloth’s ability to move heat around, zhang explains. an added benefit, he notes: the tiny tubes add “radiation resistance.”, here, granados-focil explains, “they’re talking about radio waves … wi-fi connections, that kind of radiation.” if used to encase a smartphone, he says, others “can’t access the information.” but that trait also confuses him. considering the fabric’s electrical conductivity, he wonders: “in what scenario would you need to combine those two?”, “but being able to absorb all that radiation and not to seem hotter or colder than the environment around you,” he notes — “that could give you some camouflage property.” this attribute might add appeal for military or defense-type applications., weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment, thank you for signing up!, there was a problem signing you up., byron jones believes ordinary fashion designers would have little need or interest in such applications. a mechanical engineer, jones works at kansas state university in manhattan. but years ago, he worked with companies that actually tried developing phase-change fabrics for everyday use. “my personal opinion,” he says, “is that phase-change materials in everyday clothing is more about marketing hype than it is about useful impact.”, here’s the problem, jones says. your phase-change jacket absorbs heat as you get hot, then releases it as you cool off. you hope it will keep you comfortable. but it can’t absorb all your heat. still, absorbing even 10 percent should keep you modestly comfy. and if you walk around for about 10 minutes in that jacket, 10 percent of the heat you give off over that time would come to about 72,000 joules. (joule is a unit of energy.) for comparison, a regular light bulb emits about 60 joules per second., according to the team’s data, each gram of their fabric absorbs 65 joules. not 65 joules per second. it’s 65 joules once, during the phase-change. afterwards, the polymer stops storing heat. so to absorb 72,000 joules, jones explains, your jacket must have 1,100 grams — or 2.4 pounds — of the phase-change fabric. and that’s like carrying around two and a half cans of condensed soup. he concludes, “no matter how you hype it, you can’t get around these physics.” so it might work for a jacket, but hardly a tee-shirt., jones does see some possible uses, however. it might prove useful in a situation where you only need “a few minutes” of heating or cooling capacity. “then you go back into an environment where the phase-change material is recharged” — returned to its heat-absorbing or heat-shedding state., granados-focil agrees. “this electrical conductivity business — it’s interesting,” he says. for example, in gloves, it should mean you can operate touchscreens. and it might let you touch something really hot or cold for 30 seconds, without needing clunky gloves., this technology “isn’t going to change all of our sweaters tomorrow,” granados-focil concludes. but for niche-type applications, he says “it could be interesting.”, this is one in a series presenting news on technology and innovation, made possible with generous support from the lemelson foundation., application: a particular use or function of something., camouflage: hiding people or objects from an enemy by making them appear to be part of the natural surroundings. animals can also use camouflage patterns on their skin, hide or fur to hide from predators., carbon nanotube: a nanoscale, tube-shaped material, made from carbon that conducts heat and electricity well., chemical: a substance formed from two or more atoms that unite (bond) in a fixed proportion and structure. for example, water is a chemical made when two hydrogen atoms bond to one oxygen atom. its chemical formula is h2o. chemical also can be an adjective to describe properties of materials that are the result of various reactions between different compounds., component: something that is part of something else (such as pieces that go on an electronic circuit board or ingredients that go into a cookie recipe)., crystal: (adj. crystalline) a solid consisting of a symmetrical, ordered, three-dimensional arrangement of atoms or molecules. it’s the organized structure taken by most minerals. apatite, for example, forms six-sided crystals. the mineral crystals that make up rock are usually too small to be seen with the unaided eye., development: (in engineering) the growth or change of something from an idea to a prototype., electrical conductivity: the ability of some substance (such as water or metals) to transport an electrical charge or current., engineer: a person who uses science to solve problems. as a verb, to engineer means to design a device, material or process that will solve some problem or unmet need. (v.) to perform these tasks, or the name for a person who performs such tasks., environment: the sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest)., evaporate: to turn from liquid into vapor., fabric: any flexible material that is woven, knitted or can be fused into a sheet by heat., innovation: (v. to innovate; adj. innovative) an adaptation or improvement to an existing idea, process or product that is new, clever, more effective or more practical., joule: the amount of energy needed to produce one watt for one second. joule is a standard unit of energy., marketing: the strategy for getting people to adopt a new policy or buy new products. in many cases, the marketing may rely on advertising or getting celebrities and other trendsetters to endorse a policy or product., materials scientist: a researcher who studies how the atomic and molecular structure of a material is related to its overall properties. materials scientists can design new materials or analyze existing ones. their analyses of a material’s overall properties (such as density, strength and melting point) can help engineers and other researchers select materials that are best suited to a new application., mechanical engineer: someone trained in a research field that uses physics to study motion and the properties of materials to design, build and/or test devices., molecule: an electrically neutral group of atoms that represents the smallest possible amount of a chemical compound. molecules can be made of single types of atoms or of different types. for example, the oxygen in the air is made of two oxygen atoms (o2), but water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (h2o)., nanotechnology: science, technology and engineering that deals with things and phenomena at the scale of a few billionths of a meter or less., novel: something that is clever or unusual and new, as in never seen before., physics: the scientific study of the nature and properties of matter and energy., polymer: a substance made from long chains of repeating groups of atoms. manufactured polymers include nylon, polyvinyl chloride (better known as pvc) and many types of plastics. natural polymers include rubber, silk and cellulose (found in plants and used to make paper, for example)., radiation: (in physics) one of the three major ways that energy is transferred. (the other two are conduction and convection.) in radiation, electromagnetic waves carry energy from one place to another. unlike conduction and convection, which need material to help transfer the energy, radiation can transfer energy across empty space., radio waves: waves in a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. they are a type that people now use for long-distance communication. longer than the waves of visible light, radio waves are used to transmit radio and television signals. they also are used in radar., regulate: to control with actions or some process., scenario: a possible (or likely) sequence of events and how they might play out., smartphone: a cell (or mobile) phone that can perform a host of functions, including search for information on the internet., strategy: a

'In the early hours of July 16, 1979, the Puerco River raged with a radioactive flood – the largest accidental release of radioactive material in United Sta', '[what follows is a frustrating tale of incompetence and indifference – but how did this come to be? image credit: barbara ash/shutterstock.com, the puerco river should be pretty dry in the summer. however, in the early hours of july 16, 1979, the river raged with a radioactive flood – the largest accidental release of radioactive material in united states history., despite the 94 million gallons of radioactive liquid cascading into the environment and the long-lasting effect on the local population, the situation attracted relatively little attention, outrage, or aid compared to other nuclear disasters like chornobyl or fukushima. what follows is a frustrating tale of incompetence and indifference – but how did this come to be?, the mill, the spill originated from a uranium mill in church rock, new mexico, operated by the united nuclear corporation (unc). the mill processed uranium ore extracted from the northeast church rock mine, also operated by unc from 1967., even before the church rock spill, the mill and mine were releasing radioactivity and pollution into the environment. untreated water would be discharged into the pipeline arroyo, a tributary of the puerco river – with some remembering the banks being coated with a “yellowish slime.”, accessed through two main underground shafts, around 3.5 million tons of ore were extracted in the years the mine was active. the church rock mill aimed to process 4,000 tons of this ore a day, grinding it down and soaking it in sulfuric acid to extract the uranium oxide, leaving behind a slurry of radioactive waste called tailings., these tailings were stored in big pools surrounded by huge earthen dams. however, unc failed to insulate the walls of the dams to prevent the acidic tailings from eating away at them, and the ground they were built on was unstable, raising the risk of the dams cracking – and crack they did., “fist-sized cracks” in the south side of a dam were reported by surveyor larry king shortly before the fateful spill in 1979. unc was aware of cracks forming from at least 1977., the spill, it is important to note that most of the local population was indigenous, mostly navajo. due to the dry climate, residents relied on the puerco river to water their livestock and crops, and groundwater for drinking. some even called the river tó nizhóní, translating to “beautiful water”., however, that summer morning, it was far from beautiful., at 5:30 am on july 16, 1979, disaster struck, and the dam failed. a worker flagged up the breach at 6:00 am and a temporary barrier was constructed, stopping the avalanche of solid tailings by 8:00 am. but it was too late – 94 million gallons of radioactive liquid waste was cascading down the river, alongside some of the 1,100 tons of solid tailings that also escaped., \"i remember the terrible odor and the yellowish color of the water,\" larry king told vice., \"i didn\'t know what was going on but it was an ugly feeling. i went to work and found out the dam broke,\" church rock chapter vice president robinson kelly told the navajo times., this flood of waste was acidic, with a ph less than 2. it also held around 1.36 tons of uranium, plus radium and thorium, and had a gross alpha activity of 46 trillion picocuries. for context, the maximum level of alpha particles allowed in drinking water today is 15 picocuries per liter., alpha radiation can be detrimental to health over time when ingested – for example via eating or drinking contaminated material – increasing the risk of developing cancer. exposure to elevated levels of uranium can cause kidney damage., people who tried to cross the river developed sores, blisters, and burns on their feet and legs. the gushing waste backed up sewers, and radioactivity spiked in the water, soil, and air. just after the dam broke, the river below it measured 6,000 times the allowable standard of radioactivity., the aftermath, following the spill, navajo unc employees that spoke the local indigenous language were sent out to warn residents, and the harrowing news was broadcast on the radio. however, many residents had no idea that their wells, springs, pools of water were contaminated, with children even playing in the water., high levels of radiation were found over 161 kilometers (100 miles) down the river, as far away as the petrified forest national park., the chairman of the navajo tribal council’s emergency services coordinating committee requested in august 1979 that a state of emergency and a federal disaster area be declared, but was denied by the governor of new mexico, bruce king., a report from the new mexico environmental improvement division describes the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) testing six navajo individuals who were likely exposed to the spill, finding “amounts of radioactive material normally found in the human body.” however, it has been pointed out that this initial study only accounted for exposure pathways like inhalation, not others such as drinking groundwater or consuming contaminated vegetables, which can accumulate over time., the same report recommends that “the puerco river should not be used as a primary source of water for human consumption/ livestock watering or irrigation,” citing radioactivity and toxic metals in the water. however, due to the scarcity of water in the area, locals had little choice but to use it anyway., cattle, goats, and sheep from near the river had higher concentrations of radioactivity in their bones and organs, but as older animals had higher levels, the cdc put this down to the radioactivity already present in the river. larry king told vice that in a nearby community, \"their sheep were born hairless… like baby rats,\" with butchered animals having lurid yellow stomach fat., the initial cleanup effort could be described as half-hearted at best, with only 1 percent of solid waste being removed. contaminated sediment was loaded into oil drums by workers equipped with only shovels and buckets. the cleanup only focused on the top ~7.6 centimeters (3 inches) of the riverbed, ignoring the danger seeping further into the riverbed and contamination of groundwater., however, unc remained unrepentant. as reported by the washington post in 1983, unc spokesman juan valesquez said that \"the situation with the spill is that it has all been cleaned up,\" saying that it would be \"simply erroneous to assume\" that unc’s mining activities caused elevated radiation in the river. the la times reported that in 1992, unc was ordered to set aside over $16 million for the cleanup effort, but the money was instead given to unc’s parent company., the current situation, in 1983, the site of the spill was declared a superfund site by the united states environmental protection agency (epa). the epa states that this program \"allows epa to clean up hazardous waste sites and to force responsible parties to perform cleanups or reimburse the government for cleanups led by epa.\", the epa states that the navajo nation requested the epa to take the lead in the cleanup in the 2000s. since then, around 200,000 tons of contamination were removed from the local residential area by unc, and the epa has conducted a number of five-year reviews that the protective measures put in place are effective. an annual corrective action report including groundwater analyses have been submitted by unc since 1989., unc’s mining at church rock stopped in 1982 after it was no longer profitable. however, it left a lasting imprint on the local population. although there were no deaths recorded as a direct result of the spill, many locals cite it as the source of ailments affecting them such as cancer, kidney disease, and diabetes., a 2014 paper quotes a local navajo resident jackie bell-jefferson saying: “this area used to be my playground, now it’s just a huge wound.”, sign up today to get weekly science coverage direct to your inbox, this website uses

and herd immunity.', '[find out about covid-19, covid-19 vaccines, and mayo clinic patient and visitor updates., featured conditions, understand what\'s known about herd immunity and what it means for covid-19., curious about progress toward herd immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19)? understand how herd immunity works, its role in ending the covid-19 pandemic and the challenges involved., herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease. the spread of disease from person to person becomes unlikely when herd immunity is achieved. as a result, the whole community becomes protected — not just those who are immune., often, a percentage of the population must be capable of getting a disease in order for it to spread. this is called a threshold proportion. if the proportion of the population that is immune to the disease is greater than this threshold, the spread of the disease will decline. this is known as the herd immunity threshold., what percentage of a community needs to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity? it varies from disease to disease. the more contagious a disease is, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to the disease to stop its spread. for example, the measles is a highly contagious illness. it\'s estimated that 94% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission., herd immunity can be reached when enough people in the population have recovered from a disease and have developed protective antibodies against future infection. however, experts now believe it\'ll likely be difficult to achieve herd immunity for covid-19., getting covid-19 offers some natural protection or immunity from reinfection with the virus that causes covid-19. it\'s estimated that getting covid-19 and covid-19 vaccination both result in a low risk of another infection with a similar variant for at least six months., but because reinfection is possible and covid-19 can cause severe medical complications, it\'s recommended that people who have already had covid-19 get a covid-19 vaccine. in addition, covid-19 vaccination might offer better protection than getting sick with covid-19. a recent study showed that unvaccinated people who already had covid-19 are more than twice as likely as fully vaccinated people to be reinfected with covid-19., recent research also suggests that people who got covid-19 in 2020 and then received mrna vaccines produce very high levels of antibodies that are likely effective against current and, possibly, future variants. some scientists call this hybrid immunity. further research is needed., there are some major problems with relying on community infection to create herd immunity to the virus that causes covid-19:, herd immunity also can be reached when enough people have been vaccinated against a disease and have developed protective antibodies against future infection. unlike the natural infection method, vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications. using the concept of herd immunity, vaccines have successfully controlled contagious diseases such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, rubella and many others., herd immunity makes it possible to protect the population from a disease, including those who can\'t be vaccinated, such as newborns or those who have compromised immune systems., the u.s. food and drug administration has approved two covid-19 vaccines and given emergency use authorization to a handful of covid-19 vaccines., but reaching herd immunity through vaccination against covid-19 will likely be difficult for many reasons. for example:, given the challenges, it\'s unclear if herd immunity to the virus that causes covid-19 will be reached. however, the number of fully vaccinated adults continues to rise. in addition, more than 80 million people in the u.s. have had confirmed infections with the covid-19 virus — though, again, it\'s not clear how long immunity lasts after infection., even if it isn\'t currently possible to stop transmission of the covid-19 virus, the fda-approved and fda-authorized covid-19 vaccines are highly effective at protecting against severe illness requiring hospitalization and death due to covid-19. the vaccines are allowing people to better be able to live with the virus., there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of infection. when possible, get a covid-19 vaccine. also stay up to date with covid-19 vaccines, including getting recommended booster doses, to prevent serious illness. you\'re considered up to date with your vaccines if you\'ve gotten all recommended covid-19 vaccines, including booster doses, when you become eligible., if you\'re up to date with your vaccines, you can more safely return to doing activities that you might not have been able to do because of the pandemic. however, if you are in an area with a high number of people with covid-19 in the hospital and new covid-19 cases, the cdc recommends wearing a mask indoors in public., the cdc recommends following these precautions:, if you have a chronic medical

it\'s estimated that getting covid-19 results in a low risk of another infection with a similar variant for at least six months. however, even if you have antibodies, you could get covid-19 again. because reinfection can cause severe medical complications, it\'s recommended that people who have already had covid-19 get a covid-19 vaccine., health impact. infection with the covid-19 virus could lead to serious complications and millions of deaths, especially among older people and those who have existing health conditions. the health care system could quickly become overwhelmed., vaccine hesitancy. some people object to getting a covid-19 vaccine because of religious objections, fears about the possible risks or skepticism about the benefits. if the proportion of vaccinated people in a community is below the herd immunity threshold, a contagious disease could continue to spread., protection questions. research suggests that covid-19 vaccination results in a low risk of infection with the covid-19 virus for at least six months. however, although covid-19 vaccines are effective in preventing severe illness from current and possibly future variants, people who are vaccinated and up to date on their vaccines may still get breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others., uneven vaccine access. the distribution of covid-19 vaccines has greatly varied among and within countries. if one community achieves a high covid-19 vaccination rate and surrounding areas don\'t, outbreaks can occur if the populations mix., avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms., keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters), when you\'re in indoor public spaces if you\'re not fully vaccinated. this is especially important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. keep in mind some people may have covid-19 and spread it to others, even if they don\'t have symptoms or don\'t know they have covid-19., avoid crowds and indoor places that have poor air flow (ventilation)., wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol., wear a face mask in indoor public spaces if you\'re in an area with a high number of people with covid-19 in the hospital and new covid-19 cases, whether or not you\'re vaccinated. the cdc recommends wearing the most protective mask possible that you\'ll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable., cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. throw away the used tissue. wash your hands right away., avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth., avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you\'re sick., clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, regularly., stay home from work, school and public areas and stay home in isolation if you\'re

image credit: rfranca/shutterstock.com, as the climate hots up, so too does the pressure on us to do something about it. according to the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) report, we have just 32 months – less than three years – to get our act together. before 2025, greenhouse gas emissions must peak. by 2030, carbon emissions must be cut by 43 percent, and methane emissions by about a third., “it’s now or never if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°c (2.7°f),” jim skea, co-chair of the report, said in a statement., there are, of course, myriad ways to tackle the crisis. among them are changes to agriculture, food systems, and individual diets, including veganism. , veganism is a divisive topic. taunted by many, it is lauded as a climate savior by many others. people who adopt the lifestyle have a lower carbon footprint, and the more who follow suit, the less we rely on animal agriculture – an industry renowned for its negative environmental impact. if a large enough proportion of the population were to go vegan, it may well have a positive impact on the planet, but can it *solve* climate change? , veganism is a way of living that excludes all animal products, including abstaining from eating meat, dairy, and eggs., while data on the number of vegans worldwide is hard to come by, some reports say there are 79 million vegans in the world. in the us, as of 2019, there were reportedly 9.7 million vegan americans, which represents a 30-fold rise in just 15 years., as the number of vegans continues to rise, what does this mean for the environment? to fully answer this, we must first consider the impact agriculture itself has on the planet., according to the latest ipcc report, agriculture and other land use is the third leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, behind energy and industry., , breaking this down, land use, including agriculture, was responsible for 13 percent of carbon dioxide, 44 percent of methane, and 82 percent of nitrous oxide emissions between 2007 and 2016., and animal agriculture in particular makes up a big chunk of this. the food and agriculture organization (fao) estimates that livestock is responsible for 14.5 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions – around 7.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. while another study found that meat accounted for nearly 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions from food production., the industry is an especially prolific producer of methane – which has up to 36 times the global warming potential (gwp) of carbon dioxide – and nitrous oxide – which has almost 300 times the gwp., as well as contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, animal agriculture is often accompanied by large-scale deforestation, requires lots of water, fertilizers, and land usage, and produces lots of waste, all of which contribute to its negative environmental impact., there are lots of studies out there intended to determine the impact that veganism has on the environment, and the results are often conflicting. but one thing we know for certain is that plant-based foods make less of an environmental impact than animal-based foods., “plant based foods have 10-100 times lower impact than ruminant meat [sheep, cows, goats, etc] on climate, energy, water pollution, air pollution, land use, and freshwater use,” pete smith, professor of soils and global change at the university of aberdeen and science director of scotland\'s climatexchange, told iflscience., “vegan diets have half the climate footprint of average diets.”, what does this mean in terms of emissions?, veganism is “one of the most powerful ways of reducing ones personal carbon footprint,” dr marco springmann, senior researcher on environmental sustainability and public health, nuffield department of population health, university of oxford, told iflscience., one recent study suggested that if everyone in the world were to go vegan, and animal agriculture practices were to cease, greenhouse gases would be stabilized for 30 years and 68 percent of carbon dioxide emissions would be offset for the rest of the century., there have been plenty of other studies claiming similar findings – a global transition to a vegan diet could cut food-related emissions by 70 percent, estimates another., by 2050, it could supposedly free up millions of square kilometers of land and slash carbon dioxide emissions by 8 billion tons a year. meanwhile, eating meat or seafood just once a month could reduce emissions by almost 6 billion tons a year, and a “flexitarian” diet – replacing three-quarters of meat and dairy consumption with plant-based alternatives – could save just over 5 billion tons., according to smith, global veganism “would cut 14 percent global [greenhouse gas] emissions – and free up land for sequestering carbon – so probably more.”, of course, it is neither feasible nor likely that the entire world’s population will turn to tofu tomorrow. but, the ipcc says, every little helps when it comes to making more sustainable dietary choices., “where appropriate, a shift to diets with a higher share of plant protein, moderate intake of animal-source foods and reduced intake of saturated fats could lead to substantial decreases in ghg emissions,” the latest report reads., “benefits would also include reduced land occupation and nutrient losses to the surrounding environment, while at the same time providing health benefits and reducing mortality from diet-related non-communicable diseases.”, can veganism put a stop to climate change? can any one thing tackle this imminent disaster single-handedly? it seems not. a complex problem requires a complex solution, and a single-pronged approach won’t cut it. but that’s not to say that veganism can’t form an important part of this approach., “no measure alone can solve climate change,” springmann told iflscience. although veganism is “one of the main ingredients” required to tackle it., smith agrees. “there is no magic bullet,” he told us, “but it can make a big contribution.”, and it won’t necessarily require every last one of us to make the change for this contribution to be realized, smith added., “not everyone needs to become vegan to make a difference. everyone can cut their meat and dairy consumption a bit to make a difference – smaller portion sizes, more meat free meals etc.”, good news for the climate-conscious reluctant vegans among us. and for the planet, as well, as springmann concedes that it’s “not super likely” that everyone on the planet will eventually go vegan., getting to a point where enough people are vegan, or sufficiently reducing their meat intake, that we rely less on animal agriculture will require a mix of personal initiative and political support, springmann says., and even if we get there, solving the problems of animal agriculture alone won’t magically fix this mess. as mentioned above, the energy and industry sectors are the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. transport, other land use, and buildings also contribute their fair share. and let\'s not forget other energy-guzzling processes, such as bitcoin mining, which produce as many emissions as entire countries., we have become accustomed to churning out obscene levels of emissions and, clearly, something’s got to give. , it might be just one of many changes necessary, but veganism is still a valid way we can try and reduce our impact on the planet. and who knows?

documented cases. the actual number of infections is likely significantly higher., it\'s not uncommon to see delays or gaps in the raw numbers reported. when lags occur in the covid-19 data reported by counties and states, the mayo clinic data science team uses complex statistical modeling to estimate these values until final numbers are available., at least 1 dose. this is the percentage of people in the selected population (by state or united states) who have had at least one dose of any covid-19 vaccine., fully vaccinated. this is the percentage of people in the selected population (by state or united states) who are fully vaccinated. this includes people who have had one dose of the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine or two doses of the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines., average daily cases are the average number of new cases a day for the past seven days. this seven-day rolling average is calculated to smooth out fluctuations in daily case count reporting., average positive test rate is the percentage of coronavirus tests that are positive for the virus in the past 14 days out of the total tests reported in that time period., fatality rate is the proportion of people who die of those who tested positive for covid-19., fully vaccinated is the percentage of people in the population (by state or united states) who are fully vaccinated. this includes people who have had one dose of the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine or two doses of the pfizer-biontech or moderna covid-19 vaccines., total cases are the cumulative number of cases in any given area, including probable cases and cases confirmed by testing., uncertainty interval represents the possible range of estimates with 90% probability. in our forecasted hot spots views, the uncertainty interval is shown in parentheses, from the lower bound of the estimated forecast to the upper bound of the estimated forecast., the most recent data reported in this location doesn\'t meet mayo clinic data standards. there are a range of reasons for this designation, including:, data is updated every day. it\'s not uncommon to see delays or gaps in the raw numbers reported., mayo clinic data scientists forecast future covid-19 cases using a bayesian statistical model — named for english mathematician thomas bayes. this model automatically updates predictions over time, as new data is available., mayo clinic uses a bayesian susceptible, infected, recovered (sir) model. our model parameters are updated with daily case counts every day and then use 500 simulations to produce a median forecast and 95% uncertainty interval for future cases. the infection rate used in this prediction model can vary across locations and time, due to the impact of changes in public behavior and different sars-cov-2 strains., look two weeks into the future with our precise prediction model., the cdc recommends additional doses and booster doses of covid-19 vaccines in specific instances. these include booster doses for everyone age 12 and older who received both doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19, everyone age 18 and older who received the moderna covid-19 vaccine, as well as those who are 18 and older who had a janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine. people who have a moderately or severely weakened immune system should get an additional primary dose and a booster dose., the delta (b.1.617.2) variant is nearly twice as contagious as earlier variants and might cause more severe illness. the omicron (b.1.1.529) variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes covid-19 and the delta variant. however, omicron appears to cause less severe disease., while research suggests that covid-19 vaccines are slightly less effective against the variants, the vaccines still appear to provide protection against severe covid-19., rolling up your sleeve for a covid-19 shot offers many benefits to you and the people you love:, the safety of covid-19 vaccines has been studied extensively, and adverse effects such as serious allergic reactions are rare. these vaccines were approved quickly because the red tape was cut — not corners. watch this explanation of how covid-19 vaccines were created so quickly by andrew d. badley, m.d., chair of the mayo clinic covid-19 research task force., in addition, the cdc’s independent immunization advisory group continues to evaluate and review data from rare adverse events., all vaccines cause some degree of reaction. the same is true with the covid-19 vaccines., common symptoms after your covid-19 vaccine may include:, these side effects generally go away in a few days. and treating these side effects is easier than treating covid-19., use of the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine as a primary dose or booster dose might increase the risk of a rare and serious blood-clotting disorder, especially in women ages 30 to 49., as a result, the cdc recommends getting an mrna covid-19 vaccine over getting the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine. research suggests there isn\'t an increased risk of this disorder after mrna covid-19 vaccination., serious side effects of the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine can occur within two weeks of vaccination and require emergency care. possible symptoms include:, mild to moderate headaches and muscle aches are common in the first three days after vaccination and don’t require emergency care., rarely, some people who received the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine have developed guillain-barre syndrome. this is a rare disorder in which your body\'s immune system attacks your nerves. this disorder is most often reported in men ages 50 to 64 and most often appeared within 42 days after getting the vaccine., seek immediate medical care after getting the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine if you have:, no, no and no. covid-19 vaccines prompt an immune response so that your body remembers how to fight the virus in the future. even vaccines that use genetically engineered mrna (called mrna vaccines) never enter the nucleus of your cells, where your dna is located. find out more about how different types of covid-19 vaccines work., in addition, there is currently no evidence that any covid-19 vaccines cause fertility problems. covid-19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility or miscarriage. while scientists don\'t have all of the answers about covid-19, they’re working hard to debunk these covid-19 myths and more., the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends getting an mrna covid-19 vaccine over getting the janssen/johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine. but getting any covid-19 vaccine is better than not getting a covid-19 vaccine., a covid-19 vaccine is now available to kids ages 5 and up in the u.s., a covid-19 vaccine can prevent kids from getting and spreading the covid-19 virus. if a child gets covid-19, a covid-19 vaccine could prevent him or her from becoming severely ill or experiencing short-term or long-term complications., getting a covid-19 vaccine can also help keep your child in school and more safely have playdates and participate in sports and other group activities., in the u.s., the federal government is providing covid-19 vaccines free of charge to all residents,

(the queens give off this particular aroma to woo male suitors.) when traps baited with those chemicals were placed near hornet nests in china, the traps snared thousands of males. other insects did not get trapped., researchers described their success march 14 in current biology., this work is a step toward designing pheromone traps for these hornets, says james nieh. he’s an ecologist at the university of california, san diego. such traps are already used to track and control many other types of insects., asian giant hornets are bad news for north america’s honeybees — an important but dwindling species. and the hornets could spread farther across western washington, oregon and british columbia in canada. scientists have launched efforts to stamp out this invasive species. the washington state department of agriculture even encourages citizens to help trap the hornets. homemade traps can be built with plastic bottles, orange juice and rice cooking wine.  , but the best bait is “something that would ideally be irresistible,” nieh says. something like a queen hornet’s mating pheromone. but to mimic that tempting scent, the scientists needed to know what was in it., nieh’s team used two techniques to pick out those ingredients. one was gas chromatography (kroh-muh-tah-grah-fee). the other was mass spectrometry (spek-trah-muh-tree). these methods revealed three key components of the queens’ mating fragrance. one was hexanoic (hex-uh-no-ik) acid. the second was octanoic acid. the third: decanoic acid., in the lab, the antennae of male hornets reacted to each of these compounds. the researchers took this to mean the insects were enticed by the chemicals. male hornets also reacted to a mix of all three acids. the team then crafted traps using a sticky board, a dummy hornet and a vial. the vial contained either one of the pure acids, a mix of all three or extracts from a queen hornet’s pheromone glands., the male hornets clearly preferred the gland extracts. but the pure chemicals and the chemical mix trapped many hornets too. in one test, extracts from just one gland trapped about 500 male hornets. that was more than twice the number trapped by the three-chemical cocktail. the cocktail proved about as alluring as two of the pure acids. control traps — ones lacking extracts or any of their scent chemicals — attracted few males.  , the fact that male hornets were most taken with extracts of the pheromone gland is important. it means there are probably more compounds in the pheromone that could make the traps even better, nieh says. these traps should be most useful in late fall. that’s when asian giant hornets mate., it’s unclear over what distances the traps could lure males. but queen hornets’ mating pheromones probably beckon to males far away, nieh says. this would help prevent mating between hornets that are too closely related. , the finding is “important work,” says timothy lawrence. he’s a beekeeper at washington state university in coupeville. it would be great to find a way to attract worker hornets, not just males in search of a mate, lawrence says. that way the traps could attract hornets outside of mating season. but the current results are still a “major step forward,” he adds. “the sooner we find a reliable way to attract males and find nests, the better.”, weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment, thank you for signing up!, there was a problem signing you up., agriculture: the growth of plants, animals or fungi for human needs, including food, fuel, chemicals and medicine., biology: the study of living things. the scientists who study them are known as biologists., chemical: a substance formed from two or more atoms that unite (bond) in a fixed proportion and structure. for example, water is a chemical made when two hydrogen atoms bond to one oxygen atom. its chemical formula is h2o. chemical also can be an adjective to describe properties of materials that are the result of various reactions between different compounds., chromatography: separation and detection of chemical compounds as a result of their having traveled at different rates according to their different attractions to the matter that carries them (such as a flowing liquid or gas)., component: something that is part of something else (such as pieces that go on an electronic circuit board or ingredients that go into a cookie recipe)., compound: (often used as a synonym for chemical) a compound is a substance formed when two or more chemical elements unite (bond) in fixed proportions. for example, water is a compound made of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. its chemical symbol is h2o., control: (n.) a part of an experiment where there is no change from normal conditions. the control is essential to scientific experiments. it shows that any new effect is likely due only to the part of the test that a researcher has altered. for example, if scientists were testing different types of fertilizer in a garden, they would want one section of it to remain unfertilized, as the control. its area would show how plants in this garden grow under normal conditions. and that gives scientists something against which they can compare their experimental data. (v.) to include some unchanged or unaffected conditions in an experiment so their results could later be contrasted with those from where changes had been made., ecologist: a scientist who works in a branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings., extract: (v.) to separate one chemical (or component of something) from a complex mix. (noun) a substance, often in concentrated form, that has been removed from some source material., generation: a group of individuals (in any species) born at about the same time or that are regarded as a single group. your parents belong to one generation of your family, for example, and your grandparents to another. similarly, you and everyone within a few years of your age across the planet are referred to as belonging to a particular generation of humans. the term also is sometimes extended to year classes of other animals or to types of inanimate objects (such as electronics or automobiles)., gland: a cell, a group of cells or an organ that produces and discharges a substance (or “secretion”) for use elsewhere in the body or in a body cavity, or for elimination from the body., insect: a type of arthropod that as an adult will have six segmented legs and three body parts: a head, thorax and abdomen. there are hundreds of thousands of insects, which include bees, beetles, flies and moths., invasive: an adjective that refers to something that can invade some environment (such as an invasive species) or alter some environment (such as invasive medical procedures)., invasive species: (also known as aliens) a species that is found living, and often thriving, in an ecosystem other than the one in which it evolved. some invasive species were deliberately introduced to an environment, such as a prized flower, tree or shrub. some entered an environment unintentionally, such as a fungus whose spores traveled between continents on the winds. still others may have escaped from a controlled environment, such as an aquarium or laboratory, and begun growing in the wild. what all of these so-called invasives have in common is that their populations are becoming established in a new environment, often in the absence of natural factors that would control their spread. invasive species can be plants, animals or disease-causing pathogens. many have the potential to cause harm to wildlife, people or to a region’s economy., mass spectrometry: a technique used to determine the chemical makeup of a source material., native: associated with a particular location; native plants and animals have been found in a particular location since recorded history began. these species also tend to have developed within a region, occurring there naturally (not because they were planted or moved there by people). most are particularly well adapted to their environment., pheromone: a molecule or specific mix of molecules that makes other members of the same species change their behavior or development. pheromones drift through the air and send messages to other animals, saying such things as “danger” or “i\'m looking for a mate.”, species: a group of similar organisms capable of producing offspring that can survive and reproduce., journal:​ s. dong et al. identification of giant hornet vespa mandarinia queen sex

Download Kick It Out and enjoy it on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.', '[the second version of kick it out’s reporting app provides users with the ability to attach video, photo and audio evidence to complaints to help support investigations into discriminatory abuse and behaviour across football. the free app, of which the first version was released in july 2013, allows users to confidentially report incidents they may see, hear or witness at a match. the app was developed by makepositive, a cloud technology firm specialising in salesforce, and covers over 95% of smartphones. the second version of the app has focused on gathering more conclusive evidence for investigations with new functionality allowing media to be attached to reports. a very significant new addition to the app is the option to report incidents of football-related hate crime on social media platforms. this comes after kick it out revealed 50% of complaints it received for the 2013/14 season related to social media abuse, and research commissioned by the organisation in april 2015 also estimated an abusive post was directed at a premier league player or club once every 2.6 minutes. the new version of the app also allows complainants to shield their identifying information from professional clubs and the football authorities by clicking the ‘remain anonymous’ button contained within the reporting form. women’s super league clubs have also been included in this version. steps have also been taken to make reporting grassroots and non-league incidents more user-friendly. selecting grassroots and non-league comes at the very top of the reporting form and there are now less entry fields making complaints clearer and more concise. the first release of the app built upon well-established methods of reporting, including via email and freephone, and was a huge success with 38% of all complaints from the professional game in 2013/14 coming via the app as part of an overall 269% increase in reports made to kick it out. the latest set of statistics from kick it out for the 2014/15 season shows 36% of reports registered in relation to the professional game came via the app - making it the most-used mechanism for registering complaints at that level. usage of the app has increased by 59% between the 2013/14 season (34 complaints) and the 2014/15 campaign (54 complaints) with the reporting tool becoming one of the most prominent and well-known forms of registering a complaint. anna jӧnsson, kick it out’s reporting officer, said: “as the only dedicated reporting officer at kick it out, it’s my job to handle a growing number of complaints and liaise with all parties involved. the new app not only makes it easier to do so, but will encourage more people to come forward and add their voice to the increasing numbers who want to actively remove discrimination from football. “in a perfect world, no-one would need to use our app, but with people having it in their pocket at all levels of football, we hope they will feel empowered. the new version of the app addresses some key issues and is a crucial aspect of our work towards making football open and inclusive for all.” mark richards, ceo, makepositive, said: “the team at kick it out perform a vital role in society tackling discrimination – and we are grateful for the opportunity to support them. technology is emerging as a key tool in accelerating societal and cultural changes and the latest version of the kick it out app takes advantage of the full power of the users devices to supplement the reporting process. “we are very pleased with the impact the app has made so far and look forward to supporting kick it out in the future as they continue to address this important issue.”, version 3.1.9.90, additional mandatory fields, 6 ratings, it’s awesome however you need to update as you’ve still got tottenham as at wembley., easy to use and straightforward, hope to see it make a real difference to people\'s behaviour. as for those nay-sayers, some of whom this app is designed to tackle, i think your comments reveal a lot about your personal views. now, if only i could also use this to order a pie at half time..., this app is fantastic. it works really well and allows football fans to report discrimination they see or receive at matches. great work by kick it out, the developer, make positive limited, has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to apple. for more information, see the developer’s privacy policy., the developer will be required to provide privacy details when they submit their next app update., english, fa essential information, social sports manager, the coaching manual, match report pro -

no, at least not instantly, but it wouldn’t be a particularly nice dip., tales from yellowstone national park serve as harrowing reminders of what can happen when you slip into the wrong water bodies, with people having dissolved in its hot springs. conversely, lake natron’s conditions might actually preserve your remains very well if your lifeless body was to sink into it, but it’s not somewhere you want to go paddling., it’s not, really., lake natron is actually home to a host of wildlife, perhaps most prominently the lesser flamingos who casually wade in its waters, which boast a ph of almost 12 – close to the strength of household bleach. however, part of the reason it’s so popular for the hardy flamingos is that predators can’t survive for very long in its waters, making it a hunt-free zone., as for why the water is so wild, the otherworldly environment sits in the wake of ol doinyo lengai, the only volcano on the planet to belch out one of earth’s weirdest lavas: natrocarbonatite. over time, the salty lake has absorbed sodium carbonate and other minerals in natrocarbonatite from the surrounding hills making the water a strong alkaline., the resulting ph is enough to burn the skin and eyes of most animals and spell death for those who linger too long, but if a person jumped in would it turn them to “stone” like brandt’s animals?, flamingos have tough, scaly skin that protects them from the water, but humans are a little too soft and squishy to fare so well. first of all, there’s the heat with the water in lake natron sometimes reaching a scalding 60°c (140°f)., then there are the razor-sharp clumps of salt that almost left camera operator matt aeberhard stranded in the caustic waters after his hovercraft got shredded while filming the bbc\'s a perfect planet., the extreme saltiness of the soda lake wouldn’t turn you to stone like a glance from medusa, but it would sting like hell if you had any cuts or breaks in the skin. imagine what happens when you step into the salty ocean with a graze, it’d be like that but a lot worse., then you have that near-bleach alkalinity which too would get pretty burny the longer you lingered in the water. depending on rainfall the exact ph changes but at its worst, you’d end up with corrosive burns. not fun., it’s not known for sure how the animals in brandt’s photo series died, it’s possible some may have died of natural causes and then fallen into the water. another theory centers around the uniquely mirror-like surface of the water which disorientates flying animals sometimes causing them to crash into the lake., were you to drown or have your body chucked into lake natron, the water\'s high salt content would stop the decomposition process meaning you\'d be preserved like a pickle in brine. you could even end up like the crunchy creatures in brandt’s images if the water evaporated enough to expose and dry your body. , “discovering [these animals] washed up along the shoreline of lake natron, i thought they were extraordinary — every last tiny detail perfectly preserved down to the tip of a bat\'s tongue, the minute hairs on his face,” huffpost quoted brandt from his photo book across the ravaged land., “the soda and salt causes the creatures to calcify, perfectly preserved, as they dry.\", if you don’t like the idea of turning into a salty statue, you could always go the other watery way of processing bodies: aquamation., there have been several helicopter crashes involving lake natron, some of which may have happened for the same reason so many migrating birds end up in the water. one in 2007 included a group of wildlife photographers who were hoping to film when their helicopter plunged into the lake., “the skids hit the water and we just crashed and smashed into pieces,” sydney cameraman ben herbertson told the sydney morning herald. “the next thing i knew i was in the lake and the water was burning my eyes.”, herbertson and his crew survived with the help of the local masai tribe who worked their walking sticks into makeshift stretchers to carry them out of the water, but it was a bad experience., “it was so sweltering you could dehydrate in about half an hour,” he said. “the sweat ran down your forehead and the sulphur would run back into your eyes.\'\', want our advice?

are making greater efforts to explain what type of information you are reading or watching on our site.', '[the bbc is recognised by audiences in the uk and around the world as a provider of news that you can trust. our website, like our tv and radio services, strives for journalism that is accurate, impartial, independent and fair., our editorial values say: \"the trust that our audience has in all our content underpins everything that we do. we are independent, impartial and honest. we are committed to achieving the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality and strive to avoid knowingly or materially misleading our audiences., \"our commitment to impartiality is at the heart of that relationship of trust. in all our output we will treat every subject with an impartiality that reflects the full range of views. we will consider all the relevant facts fairly and with an open mind.\", research shows that, compared to other broadcasters, newspapers and online sites, the bbc is seen as by far the most trusted and impartial news provider in the uk [pdf]., even so, we know that identifying credible journalism on the internet can be a confusing experience. we also know that audiences want to understand more about how bbc journalism is produced., for these reasons, bbc news is making even greater efforts to explain what type of information you are reading or watching on our website, who and where the information is coming from, and how a story was crafted the way it was. by doing so, we can help you judge for yourself why bbc news can be trusted., we are also making these indicators of trustworthy journalism \"machine-readable\", meaning that they can be picked up by search engines and social media platforms, helping them to better identify reliable sources of information too., these indicators comprise the following areas:, the bbc has long had its own editorial guidelines that apply to all of our content and set out the standards expected of our journalists. to make it easier to see how bbc guidelines are used in our newsroom, we have listed all the relevant sections on this page., mission statement: the mission of the bbc is to act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services that inform, educate and entertain. full details are in the bbc charter., ownership structure, funding and grants: we are independent of outside interests and arrangements that could undermine our editorial integrity. our audiences should be confident that our decisions are not influenced by outside interests, political or commercial pressures, or any personal interests. learn more about how bbc news is funded, in the uk and internationally, in the bbc charter on the independence of the bbc., other links:, founding date: the bbc was founded on 18 october 1922. read more about the history of the bbc., ethics policy: the bbc\'s editorial guidelines outline the editorial values and practices that all our output is expected to conform to., other links:, diversity policy: learn about bbc news\' commitment to diversity in the bbc charter., other links:, diversity staffing report: find out about how bbc news is working to increase diversity in the bbc\'s equality information report., corrections: the bbc is committed to achieving due accuracy. policies relating to corrections can be found in the following sections of our editorial guidelines., our output must be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. we should be honest and open about what we don\'t know and avoid unfounded speculation. claims, allegations, material facts and other content that cannot be corroborated should normally be attributed., we are open in acknowledging mistakes when they are made and encourage a culture of willingness to learn from them., if an article has been edited since publication to correct a material inaccuracy, a note will be added at the end of the text to signal to the reader there has been an amendment or correction with the date of that change. if there is a small error in a story that does not alter its editorial meaning (eg name misspelling), the correction will be made without an additional note., unless content is specifically made available only for a limited time period, there is a presumption that material published online will become part of a permanently accessible archive and will not normally be removed. exceptional circumstances may include legal reasons, personal safety risks, or a serious breach of editorial standards that cannot be rectified except by removal of the material., other links:, verification/fact-checking standards: the bbc\'s accuracy and verification policy is outlined in the editorial guidelines on accuracy., other links:, unnamed sources: the bbc\'s policy and guidance on the use of anonymous sources is detailed in the editorial guidelines., other links:, actionable feedback: the bbc\'s complaints procedure is outlined in the bbc complaints framework., other links:, leadership: meet the senior executive team that runs the news division: bbc news board., bbc news articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism., general news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, bbc newsgathering and bbc broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines., article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found., bbc news distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. we use machine-readable labels in six categories:, our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. we strive to be honest and open about what we don\'t know and avoid unfounded speculation., where bbc news relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. we usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on., whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment., for in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods., © 2022 bbc. the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites. read about our

answers, multimedia, resources, news from mayo clinic, what\'s new, avoid nausea triggers. whether it\'s the smell of foods in the break room or other odors or tastes, steer clear of anything that triggers nausea., snack often. crackers and other bland foods can be lifesavers during nausea. keep a stash at work for easy snacking. ginger ale made with real ginger or ginger tea might help, too., take vitamin b-6. this is considered safe during pregnancy and is easily available. it might help quell nausea. adding doxylamine (unisom) or diphenhydramine at bedtime can also help. but it\'s better not to take them during the day because they can cause sleepiness., ask about prescription anti-nausea medications. for severe nausea and vomiting with weight loss, your health care provider might be able to prescribe medication., eat foods rich in iron and protein. fatigue can be a symptom of iron deficiency anemia but adjusting your diet can help. choose foods such as lean red meat, poultry, seafood, leafy green vegetables, iron-fortified whole-grain cereal and beans., take short, frequent breaks. getting up and moving around for a few minutes can be helpful. spending a few minutes with lights off, eyes shut and feet up also might help., drink plenty of fluids. keep a water bottle nearby and sip throughout the day. drink earlier in the day rather than near bedtime to cut down on trips to the bathroom interrupting sleep., cut back on activities. scaling back on nonwork activities might create more time to rest after work. consider shopping online or hiring someone to clean your house or take care of the yard., keep up a fitness routine. physical activity can help boost energy levels — especially for those who sit at a desk all day. take a walk after work or join a prenatal fitness class, as long as your health care provider says it\'s ok., go to bed early. aim for at least eight hours of sleep every night. resting on the left or right side will keep blood flowing well to the baby and ease swelling. for added comfort, place pillows between the legs and under the belly., sitting. using an adjustable chair with good lower back support can make long hours of sitting much easier — especially as body weight and posture change. for chairs that aren\'t adjustable, use a small pillow or cushion to provide extra support for the back. elevate the legs to decrease swelling., standing. for those who must stand for long periods, putting one foot up on a footrest, low stool or box can help. switch feet every so often and take frequent breaks. wear comfortable shoes with good arch support. consider wearing support or compression hose., bending and lifting. even when lifting something light, proper form can spare the back. bend at the knees, not at the waist. keep the load close to the body, lifting with the legs — not the back. avoid twisting the body while lifting., take control. make daily to-do lists and prioritize tasks. consider what to delegate to someone — or eliminate., talk it out. share frustrations with a supportive co-worker, friend or loved one., relax. practice relaxation techniques, such as breathing slowly or imagining a calm place. mindfulness and meditation apps might be helpful. try a prenatal yoga class, as long as your health care provider says it\'s ok., exposure to harmful substances, prolonged standing, heavy lifting, climbing or carrying, excessive noise, extreme temperatures, share, tweet, body changes and discomforts. u.s. department of health and human services.

long-lasting power. and with apple silicon, it’s even faster than ever before.2, we’re always working to make the fastest desktop browser on the planet even faster., safari lets you do more online on a single charge than any other browser., up to 1.5 hours more streaming videos compared with chrome, edge, and firefox4, up to 30 minutes more browsing compared with chrome, edge, and firefox4, safari outperforms both mac and pc browsers in benchmark after benchmark on the same mac.5, javascript performance on advanced web applications.5, safari vs. other mac browsers, safari on macos, chrome on

apple tv+.6 and it runs efficiently for longer-lasting battery life., online privacy isn’t just something you should hope for — it’s something you should expect. that’s why safari comes with industry-leading privacy protection technology built in, including intelligent tracking prevention that identifies trackers and helps prevent them from profiling or following you across the web. upgrading to icloud+ gives you even more privacy protections, including the ability to sign up for websites and services without having to share your personal email address., safari stops trackers in their tracks., what you browse is no one’s business but your own. safari has built‑in protections to help stop websites and data-collection companies from watching and profiling you based on your browsing activity. intelligent tracking prevention uses on-device intelligence to help prevent cross-site tracking and stops known trackers from using your ip address — making it incredibly difficult to learn who you are and what you’re interested in., safari makes it simple to see how your privacy is protected on all the websites you visit. click the privacy report button in your toolbar for a snapshot of cross-site trackers currently prevented from profiling you on the website you’re visiting. or view a weekly privacy report to see how safari protects you as you browse over time., safari is more customizable than ever. organize your tabs into tab groups so it’s easy to go from one interest to the next. set a custom background image and fine-tune your browser window with your favorite features — like reading list, favorites, icloud tabs, and siri suggestions. and third-party extensions for iphone, ipad, and mac let you do even more with safari, so you can browse the way you want across all your devices., save and organize your tabs in the way that works best for you. name your tab groups, edit them, and switch between them across devices., safari extensions add functionality to your browser to help you explore the web the way you want. find and add your favorite extensions in the dedicated safari category on the app store., new built-in tools let you interact with the web like never before, creating a browsing experience that’s far more immersive, intuitive, and immediate. get detailed information about a subject in a photo with just a click, select text within any image, instantly translate an entire web page, and quickly take notes wherever you are on a site — without having to switch apps., notes is your go-to app to capture any thought. and with the new quick note feature, you can instantly jot down ideas as you browse websites without having to leave safari., translate entire web pages between eight languages with a single click., hallo, hola, bonjour, hello, привет, 你好, olá, こんにちは, interact with text in any image on the web using functions like copy and paste, lookup, and translate.7, quickly learn more about landmarks, works of art, breeds of dogs, and more with only a photo or an image you find online., strong security protections in safari help keep you safe. like icloud keychain, which securely stores and autofills your passwords across all your devices. if a password breach is detected, password monitoring alerts you. safari also notifies you when it encounters suspicious websites and prevents them from loading. because it loads each web page in a separate process, any harmful code is always confined to a single browser tab so it won’t crash the entire application or access your data. and now safari automatically upgrades sites from http to the more secure https when available., if your password is involved in a data breach, password monitoring alerts you and helps you change your password., safari automatically keeps an eye out for any saved passwords that may have been involved in a data breach. using advanced cryptographic techniques, safari periodically checks a derivation of your passwords against an updated list of compromised credentials. if a breach is discovered, safari helps you upgrade your existing passwords. all this is done without revealing your password information to anyone — including apple., apple pay is the easiest and most secure way to shop on safari — allowing you to complete transactions with face id or touch id on your iphone or ipad, with touch id on your macbook pro or macbook air, or by double-clicking the side button on your apple watch. your credit card details are never shared, and your transactions are protected with industry-leading security., safari works seamlessly and syncs your passwords, bookmarks, history, tabs, and more across mac, ipad, iphone, and apple watch. and when your mac, ios, or ipados devices are near each other, they can automatically pass what you’re doing in safari from one device to another using handoff. you can even copy images, video, or text from safari on your iphone or ipad, then paste into another app on your nearby mac — or vice versa., when you use safari on multiple devices, your tabs carry over from one apple device to another. so you can search, shop, work, or browse on your iphone, then switch to your ipad or mac and pick up right where you left off., save web pages you want to read later by adding them to your reading list. then view them on any of your icloud-connected devices — even if you’re not connected to the internet., icloud keychain securely stores your user names, passwords, and credit card numbers and keeps them up to date on your trusted devices. so you can easily sign in to your favorite websites — as well as apps on ios and ipados — and quickly make online purchases., deep webkit integration between mac hardware and macos allows safari to deliver the fastest performance and the longest battery life of any browser on the platform, while supporting modern web standards for rich experiences in the browser. webkit in macos monterey includes optimizations that enable even richer browsing experiences., learn more]', 'safari - apple', '[safari, blazing fast. incredibly private., performance, more with the battery.

chronicles, which was an early naughties sensation, has returned to the fray. her new book, the palace papers: inside the house of windsor - the truth and the turmoil, examines how that quest to ensure the monarchy is not simply a platform for family members to seek public acclaim has turned out. even a cursory look at the royal landscape would suggest things have not gone entirely to plan. while no conventional royal historian, brown tackles her subjects with the same brio she brought to her years as a highly regarded magazine editor, first with tatler, then with vanity fair and the new yorker. her access to those who flit around the royals gives her writing an edgy authenticity. the book, she says, is the result of two years\' work - and impeccable sources. \'i talked to more than 120 people, many of whom have been intimately involved with the senior royals and their households during the turbulent years since diana died,\' she explained. the result is a tour d\'horizon of the recent travails of the royal family, which is both critical of and surprisingly sympathetic to the figure at the heart of the story: the 96-year-old queen, whose head-in-the-sand approach or \'ostriching\' she often mocks. , the incident unfolded on tuesday in sarasota, when mother-of-four melissa bakondy (top right) got up to the podium for the public comment period to complain about a

giant for opposing the state\'s law banning school lessons on gender or sexual orientation before fourth grade.  lawyer jenna ellis (left) said that although she disagrees with disney\'s opposition to the so-called \'don\'t say gay\' law, florida\'s move to punish the company amounts to an infringement on free speech., the florida governor wrote into law the plan which scrapped the reedy creek

over to me and the other three, or the other two, and asked if her kids were okay and i told her they were still in there,\' garrison told fox 55. garrison said mann got on top of his truck to try to

simply sign a sheet of paper saying you authorize the cpr to release your sf 50 and be sure to both print and sign your name. then scan and upload that document or pdf to your email to the cpr., once the cpr receives your request, they will process it through all their systems to determine if they have a possible record.  if no record is found, they will send a negative response letter.  if a record is found, it will be sent to the address or fax number provided.,  , we know we already said that, but these two things are so important!,  , very often, people resist providing all of the information needed to complete a request.  while it’s understandable to be hesitant to share pii to request an sf 50, please know that, much like the nprc does when veterans request their military documents, the cpr needs this information for your security. it is the way to ensure the correct records are not only located, and match the information provided, but are also sent to the correct person and only the correct person. ,  , please provide a thorough request with all the above-mentioned information and make sure you sign it, or it could slow down the process.,  ,  , prior to the covid pandemic, the cpr had a turnaround time of ten days, but they are unable to guarantee such a time frame now. the cpr is currently focusing on emergency requests only as they are working with a reduced staff. if your request is an emergency, please state that on your request and they will do all they can to assist you.,  , emergency requests may be faxed to 618-935-3095 but must contain the reason for the emergency/urgency.  and yes, it can be urgently needed for employment reasons if time is of the essence for applying for a position.,  , if you do not have an urgent need for your sf 50, please be patient as the staff at the cpr are working on emergency requests. ,  , also please know that your official personnel file is not filed in a large filing cabinet under your last name (or there would be 500 rows, all 10,000 feet long for former employees named john smith alone).  the cpr uses a filing system based on other criteria, likely based on year and government agency, and searching for these records takes time and accuracy.  the cpr values your privacy and your records, so please know that they take the utmost care when pulling your records.  they are working as fast as they can for you under difficult circumstances!,  , email your inquiry to cpr.center@nara.gov,  ,  , be sure to read the job posting thoroughly to see what kind of sf 50 is required.  very often, they will not accept an award sf 50.  if you received a cash bonus and a new sf 50 was created to document that award, it’s best not to use that sf 50 when applying for new positions with the federal government.  try to use the most recent and general sf 50 in your folder.,  , the cpr can be relied on to pull your final sf 50 if you are no longer in federal service; however, if you are accessing your eopf yourself, just be aware that there are different types of sf 50s!,  ,  , hopefully, this information has removed some of the mystery behind the sf 50 and prepared you for what to expect if requesting it from the cpr.  it’s possible that the future will involve the cpr being able to securely send sf 50s digitally, or via email, much like the nprc is beginning to do for veterans.  until then, please continue to mail/fax/or email your requests to the cpr using the information provided here. ,  , if you want to know even more about the specifics of the sf 50, usajobs has a useful webpage with even more detailed information you can check out here, reading your sf-50 to determine your service and appointment type.,  , interesting fact: technically, the records are in a cave.  yes, your former personnel file lives in a climate-controlled cave that is quite amazing inside.  caves are common storage facilities in the midwest and if you’re curious how the national archives utilizes caves as storage facilities, check out our web page, the national archives goes underground.,  , if this blog did not answer your question(s), please let us know what we left out and we’ll do what history hub does best – find the answers for you!

climate model of the last two million years reveals the climatic conditions in which human species thrived, and how global climat', '[homo sapiens (purple shading, left), homo heidelbergensis (red shading, middle), homo neanderthalensis (blue shading, right) had different preferred climates, as calculated from a new paleoclimate model simulation and a compilation of fossil and archeological data. lighter values indicate higher habitat suitability. dates refer to the estimated ages of the youngest and oldest fossils used in the study. image credit: institute for basic science, before humanity changed the climate, shifting climates changed humanity, a new study has found. although the conclusion is in line with expectations, it took a truly immense amount of computing power to provide the evidence. the work has already provided a basis for answering previously much more uncertain questions about our evolution., we can see from the species around us that animals respond to changing climatic conditions by adjusting their range. anthropologists have long suspected the same was true for human ancestors. however, climate records from the sites where ancient human fossils have been found are sparse, and the sites themselves potentially unrepresentative, leaving the climatic influence on our evolution speculative., however, a team led by professor axel timmermann of pusan national university noted we don\'t need local proxies to know the climate at a particular site and time if we know what global conditions were like. fine-scaled climate modeling has been restricted to much more recent timescales, but in nature, timmermann and co-authors have changed that. they ran aleph, one of south korea\'s most powerful supercomputers, for six months to create the first really detailed climate model that stretches back two million years. they then focused on conditions at locations where human fossils and tools have been found at the times they were found there, looking at rainfall and plant productivity, as well as seasonal temperatures., “even though different groups of archaic humans preferred different climatic environments, their habitats all responded to climate shifts caused by astronomical changes in earth’s axis wobble, tilt, and orbital eccentricity with timescales ranging from 21 to 400 thousand years,” timmerman said in a statement. , the work required aleph to produce 500 terabytes of data, which the team notes would fill hundreds of hard disks., to confirm their conclusions, timmerman and co-authors shuffled the ages of the evidence of human presence. if climate was not affecting where humans chose to live, they reasoned, this wouldn\'t matter. instead, they found homo sapiens, neanderthals and h. heidelbergensis disappeared from parts of their range when conditions became unsuitable and reappeared when the times suited them., having achieved the expected result, the authors then used their model to tackle more open questions, the first being when different human species habitats\' might have overlapped. this can then be used to explore when there might have been contact, and therefore interbreeding, between species., the authors concluded homo heidelbergensis split into two lines, one in eurasia and the other in africa. between 400,000-500,000 years ago the eurasian line could have shared space with neanderthals, and probably denisovans, suggesting this is where those species evolved. homo sapiens emerged out of the southern african side of the human family 300,000 years ago, distinguished in part by an affinity for drier climates., “our climate-based reconstruction of hominin lineages is quite similar to recent estimates obtained from either genetic data or the analysis of morphological differences in human fossils, which increases our confidence in the results,” said co-author dr jiaoyang ruan., looking further back, the team detected an important shift in our ancestors\' preferences. “early african hominins around 2-1 million years ago preferred stable climatic conditions. this constrained them to relatively narrow habitable corridors,” said pusan national university phd student elke zeller. , this changed around 800,000 years ago when h. heidelbergensis broadened their dietary preferences compared to their predecessors h. habilis and h. ergaster, and began expanding to a wider range of habitats. subsequent generations of humans have maintained this adaptability, although a shortage of fossils led some, such as h. floresiensis to be excluded from the analysis., not only has this enabled humanity to occupy a vast diversity of locations, it has also benefited us as the pace of global climate cycles sped up. “we are who we are because we have managed to adapt over millennia to slow shifts in the past climate,” timmerman said. whether we can cope with changes we are inducing to the climate that operate at least 10 times faster than any of our ancestors faced remains to be seen., sign up today to get weekly science coverage direct to your inbox, this website uses cookies, this website uses cookies to improve user experience. by

(variables are unknown values typically written as letters)., the difference between an expression and an equation is sort of like the difference between a phrase and a sentence. a phrase contains a single idea that is incomplete by itself. a sentence makes a complete statement. likewise, an expression conveys a single idea — such as “one plus two” (1+2) or “x minus y” (x–y). an equation represents a complete sentence, such as one plus two equals three (1+2=3). or, x minus y equals z (x–y=z)., formulas are a special type of equation. they express an important relationship between two or more variables. for instance, the formula a=πr2 shows how the area of a circle (a) is related to its radius (r). (the area equals the constant pi (π) times the radius squared.) formulas are used to express many rules in geometry and laws of physics. one example is f=ma. that is, force (f) equals mass (m) times acceleration (a)., equations are not the only kind of “complete sentences” in math. inequalities also link up expressions to form complete ideas. an inequality says that one expression is bigger or smaller than another. for example, “x is greater than y” (x > y) or “y is less than z” (y < z). but inequalities don’t contain equal signs. so they aren’t equations., the drake equation relates the number of advanced alien civilizations that could exist in our galaxy to factors such as the number of stars with planets and the number of those planets that could host life., check out the full list

speed or direction of some object., constant: (in mathematics) a number that is known and unchanging, usually based on some mathematical definition. for example, π (pi) is a constant equal to 3.14. . . and defined as the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter., equation: in mathematics, the statement that two quantities are equal. in geometry, equations are often used to determine the shape of a curve or surface., expression: (in mathematics) a statement that involves combinations of numbers and/or letters (that signify numbers that may vary) and includes directions (or rules) about what to do with those numbers (such as add or divide them, take their logarithm or make combinations of them equal one another)., force: some outside influence that can change the motion of a body, hold bodies close to one another, or produce motion or stress in a stationary body., link: a connection between two people or things., physics: the scientific study of the nature and properties of matter and energy. classical physics is an explanation of the nature and properties of matter and energy that relies on descriptions such as newton’s laws of motion. quantum physics, a field of study that emerged later, is a more accurate way of explaining the motions and behavior of matter. a scientist who works in such areas is known as a physicist., pi: (in mathematics) usually written using the greek letter π. it is a constant equal to 3.14. . . and defined as the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter., radius: a straight line from the center to the circumference of a circle or sphere., square: (in mathematics) a number multiplied by itself, or the verb meaning to multiply a number by itself. the square of 2 is 4; the square of 10 is 100., variable: (in

Here s why.', '[find out about covid-19, covid-19 vaccines, and mayo clinic patient and visitor updates., featured conditions, wonder if you need to take prenatal vitamins? or what to do if they make you constipated? get answers to these questions and more., a healthy diet is the best way to get the vitamins and minerals you need. but during pregnancy you might fall short on key nutrients. if you\'re pregnant or hoping to conceive, prenatal vitamins can help fill any gaps., during pregnancy, you need more folic acid and iron than usual. here\'s why:, prenatal vitamins are available over-the-counter in nearly any pharmacy. your health care provider might recommend a specific brand or leave the choice up to you., beyond checking for folic acid and iron, look for a prenatal vitamin that contains calcium and vitamin d. they help promote the development of the baby\'s teeth and bones. it also might be beneficial to look for a prenatal vitamin that contains vitamin c, vitamin a, vitamin e, b vitamins, zinc and iodine., in addition, your health care provider might suggest higher doses of certain nutrients depending on the circumstances. for example, if you\'ve given birth to a baby who has a neural tube defect, your health care provider might recommend a separate supplement containing a higher dose of folic acid — such as 4 milligrams (4,000 micrograms) — before and during any subsequent pregnancies., but in general, avoid taking extra prenatal vitamins or multivitamins with dosing in excess of what you need on a daily basis. high doses of some vitamins may be harmful to your baby. for example, extra vitamin a during pregnancy can potentially cause harm to your baby., omega-3 fatty acids, a type of fat found naturally in many kinds of fish, help promote a baby\'s brain development. if you don\'t eat fish or other foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, your health care provider might recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplements in addition to prenatal vitamins., ideally, you\'ll start taking prenatal vitamins before conception. in fact, it\'s generally a good idea for women of reproductive age to regularly take a prenatal vitamin. the baby\'s neural tube, which becomes the brain and spinal cord, develops during the first month of pregnancy — perhaps before you even know that you\'re pregnant., sometimes the iron in prenatal vitamins contributes to

Atacama desert changed the behavior of the inhabitants relative to the sea for 1,000 years thereafter, with buildings and grave', '[these stones once came from a building housing the indigenous people of the atacama desert, but their home was destroyed by a tsunami, with the direction of collapse indicating it was the backwash that did the damage. no one built in the area for another 1000 years. image credit gabriel easton, evidence of an earthquake off the coast of chile as powerful as any recorded has been found by archaeologists. the quake generated an enormous tsunami, devastating for people living on the coastal plain. for a thousand years after the megaquake, inhabitants of the area moved their dwellings and burial sites to higher ground – despite the inconvenience when the sea was their main food source., the most energetic earthquake since the invention of seismometers took place in 1960 in southern chile, registering 9.5 on the moment magnitude (mw) scale. even thousands of kilometers away in hawaii, 10 meter (35 foot) waves wreaked havoc on shorelines facing the wrong way. estimates of deaths in chile range as high as 6,000, despite an epicenter beneath a relatively unpopulated area., chile has experienced many other large earthquakes before and since as a result of the south american plate riding over the nazca plate, the same process forcing up the andes. so it is unsurprising that professor james goff of the university of southampton and co-authors claim in science advances to have found deposits left behind by tsunamis further north., the evidence is seen in the form of marine sediments and fossils far above the current sea level, let alone that in earlier times. some have likely dates coinciding with smaller recorded tsunamis from japan., although such past events were to be expected, the height and length of one dated around 3,800 years ago was not. for a thousand kilometers, sediments are deposited so high above what was then the shoreline that the quake responsible must have measured around 9.5 (mw)., “it had been thought that there could not be an event of that size in the north of the country simply because you could not get a long enough rupture,” goff said in a statement. , if the size of this quake, stretching for around a thousand kilometers, surprised the researchers, the response of atacama’s indigenous people was more amazing still., the atacama is one of the least habitable places for humans on earth, with parts thought to have experienced no rain for up to a million years. however, the waters that border it are among the most abundant on earth thanks to nutrients brought up by the humbolt current. for at least 12,000 years, humans have survived there, with a diet rich marine foods., for a thousand years of that time, however, behavior changed. stone structures and graveyards disappeared from the atacama’s coast. instead, equivalent traces of human presence were found 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. yet the diet of the people of the area barely varied, suggesting they preferred to make long treks to access the sea’s bounty, before returning inland to avoid its wrath., “the local population there were left with nothing,” goff said. “our archaeological work found that a huge social upheaval followed as communities moved inland beyond the reach of tsunamis. it was over 1000 years before people returned to live at the coast again which is an amazing length of time given that they relied on the sea for food.”, there is evidence indigenous australians have preserved tales of natural disasters for many thousands of years, so the fact the tsunami survived in the collective memory of the atacameño for a thousand is not a total shock. more extraordinary is that the warnings were so powerful people avoided living near their primary food source., this was no mere local disaster. goff was alerted to the possibility of an event this large when studying enormous boulders on new zealand’s chatham island placed by a tsunami. judging from their locations, goff concluded the waves that dragged them there must have originated in northern chile., what has happened once can happen again, and goff warns the tsunami would have devastated many pacific islands that were uninhabited at the time, but are now heavily populated and unprepared for a repetition.,  , sign up today to get weekly

(that’s a 1 followed by 36 zeroes.), gravity and electromagnetism are the two forces we can feel in our daily lives. the other two forces act inside atoms. we cannot directly feel their effects. but these forces are no less important. without them, matter as we know it could not exist., the weak force controls the interactions of tiny particles called quarks. quarks are the fundamental bits of matter that make up protons and neutrons. those are the particles that make up the cores of atoms. quark interactions are complex. sometimes, they release huge amounts of energy. one series of these reactions happens inside stars. weak-force interactions cause some particles in the sun to transform into others. in the process, they release energy. so the weak force may sound wimpy, but it causes the sun and all other stars to shine., weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment, thank you for signing up!, there was a problem signing you up., the weak force also sets the rules for how radioactive atoms decay. the decay of radioactive carbon-14 atoms, for instance, helps archaeologists date ancient artifacts., historically, scientists have thought of electromagnetism and the weak force as different things. but recently, researchers have linked these forces together. just as electricity and magnetism are two aspects of one force, electromagnetism and the weak force are related., this raises an intriguing possibility. could all four of the fundamental forces be connected? no one has proved this idea yet. but it is an exciting question on the frontiers of physics., the strong force is the final fundamental force. it’s what keeps matter stable. protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of every atom. neutrons have no electric charge. but protons are positively charged. remember, the electromagnetic force causes like charges to repel. so why don’t the protons in an atomic nucleus fly apart? the strong force holds them together. at the scale of an atomic nucleus, the strong force is 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force that is attempting to push the protons apart. it is also strong enough to hold the quarks inside protons and neutrons together., notice that none of the four fundamental forces requires objects to touch. the sun’s gravity attracts earth from afar. if you hold the opposite poles of two bar magnets near each other, they will pull on your hands. newton called this “action-at-a-distance.” today, scientists are still searching for some of the particles that “carry” forces from one object to another., light particles, or photons, are known to carry the electromagnetic force. particles called gluons are responsible for the strong force — holding atomic nuclei together like glue. a complicated set of particles carries the weak force. but the particle responsible for gravity is still at large. physicists think gravity is carried by particles called gravitons. but no gravitons have ever been observed., still, we don’t need to know everything about the four forces to appreciate their impacts. next time you drop down the hill on a rollercoaster, thank gravity for the thrill. when your bike is able to brake at a stop light, remember the electromagnetic force made it possible. as the sunlight warms your face outdoors, appreciate the weak force. finally, hold a book in your hand and consider that the strong force is what holds it — and you — together., acceleration: a change in the speed or direction of some object., artifact: some human-made object (such as a pot or brick) that can be used as one gauge of a community’s culture or history. (in statistics or experiments) something measured or observed that is not naturally a part of some system. it was instead introduced accidentally as a result of how the measurement or study was performed., atom: the basic unit of a chemical element. atoms are made up of a dense nucleus that contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons. the nucleus is orbited by a cloud of negatively charged electrons., atomic: having to do with atoms, the smallest possible unit that makes up a chemical element., cosmos: (adj. cosmic) a term that refers to the universe and everything within it., decay: (for radioactive materials) the process whereby a radioactive isotope — which means a physically unstable form of some element — sheds energy and subatomic particles. in time, this shedding will transform the unstable element into a slightly different but stable element. for instance, uranium-238 (which is a radioactive, or unstable, isotope) decays to radium-222 (also a radioactive isotope), which decays to radon-222 (also radioactive), which decays to polonium-210 (also radioactive), which decays to lead-206 — which is stable. no further decay occurs. the rates of decay from one isotope to another can range from timeframes of less than a second to billions of years., electric charge: the physical property responsible for electric force; it can be negative or positive., electricity: a flow of charge, usually from the movement of negatively charged particles, called electrons., electromagnetic: an adjective referring to light radiation, to magnetism or to both., electromagnetic force: ( also known as electromagnetism ) one of the four fundamental forces of nature. it’s the force that causes electrically charged particles to interact. the regions over which these interactions occur are known as electromagnetic fields., electromagnetism: the science that has to do with the physical links between electricity and magnetism. it’s also the term for the properties of an electric current that cause it to generate a magnetic field. this term can also be applied to the physical force (the electromagnetic force) that governs interactions between charged particles and which are due to their electric charge and their release or absorption of light (photons)., electron: a negatively charged particle, usually found orbiting the outer regions of an atom; also, the carrier of electricity within solids., force: some outside influence that can change the motion of a body, hold bodies close to one another, or produce motion or stress in a stationary body., friction: the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over or through another material (such as a fluid or a gas). friction generally causes a heating, which can damage a surface of some material as it rubs against another., fundamental: something that is basic or serves as the foundation for another thing or idea., gluon: a subatomic particle believed to bind other particles together., graviton: a hypothetical particle that many physicists suspect is the basic unit contributing to a gravitational field. it would have no mass or electric charge and move at the speed of light. in that sense, it is somewhat like the photon, the basic unit of light., gravity: the force that attracts anything with mass, or bulk, toward any other thing with mass. the more mass that something has, the greater its gravity., isaac newton: this english physicist and mathematician became most famous for describing his law of gravity. born in 1642, he developed into a scientist with wide-ranging interests. among some of his discoveries: that white light is made from a combination of all the colors in the rainbow, which can be split apart again using a prism; the mathematics that describe the orbital motions of things around a center of force; that the speed of sound waves can be calculated from the density of air; early elements of the mathematics now known as calculus; and an explanation for why things “fall:” the gravitational pull of one object towards another, which would be proportional to the mass of each. newton died in 1727., jupiter: (in astronomy) the solar system’s largest planet, it has the shortest day length (9 hours, 55 minutes). a gas giant, its low density indicates that this planet is composed mostly of the light elements hydrogen and helium. this planet also releases more heat than it receives from the sun as gravity compresses its mass (and slowly shrinks the planet)., magnet: a material that usually contains iron and whose atoms are arranged so they attract certain metals., magnetism: the attractive influence, or force, created by certain materials, called magnets, or by the movement of electric charges., mass: a number that shows how much an object resists speeding up and slowing down — basically a measure of how much matter that object is made from., matter: something that occupies space and has mass. anything on earth with matter will have a property described as \"weight.\", neutron: a subatomic particle carrying no electric charge that is one of the basic pieces of matter. neutrons belong to the family of particles known as hadrons., newton: a unit of force named for sir isaac newton, a 17th century english physicist and mathematician. one newton is an amount that would give a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one meter per second per second., nucleus: plural is nuclei. (in physics) the central core of an atom, containing most of its mass., orbit: the curved path of a celestial object or spacecraft around a galaxy, star, planet or moon. one complete circuit around a celestial body., particle: a minute amount of something., photon: a particle representing the smallest possible amount of light or other type of electromagnetic radiation., physics: the scientific study of the nature and properties of matter and energy. classical physics is an explanation of the nature and properties of matter and energy that relies on descriptions such as newton’s laws of motion. quantum physics, a field of study that emerged later, is a more accurate way of explaining the motions and behavior of matter. a scientist who works in such areas is known as a physicist., poles: (in physics and electrical engineering) the ends of a magnet. (in chemistry) two areas of opposite electrical charge, one positive and one negative., proton: a subatomic particle that is one of the basic building blocks of the atoms that make up matter. protons belong to the family of particles known as hadrons., quarks: a family of subatomic particles that each carries a fractional electric charge. quarks are building blocks of particles called hadrons. quarks come in types, or “flavors,” known as: up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom., radioactive: an adjective that describes unstable elements, such as certain forms (isotopes) of uranium and plutonium. such elements are said to be unstable because their nucleus sheds energy that is carried away by photons and/or and often one or more subatomic particles. this emission of energy is by a process known as radioactive decay., star: the basic building block from which galaxies are made. stars develop when gravity compacts clouds of gas. when they become hot enough, stars will emit light and sometimes other forms of electromagnetic radiation. the sun is our closest star., sun: the star at the center of earth’s solar system. it is about 27,000 light-years from the center of the milky way galaxy. also a term for any sunlike star., unit: (in measurements) a unit of measurement is a standard way of expressing a physical quantity. units of measure provide context for what numerical values represent and so convey the magnitude of physical properties. examples include inches, kilograms, ohms, gauss, decibels, kelvins and nanoseconds., universe: the entire cosmos: all things that exist throughout space and time. it has been expanding since its formation during an event known as the big bang, some 13.8 billion years ago (give or take a few hundred million years)., free educator

Engineers are turning this renewable, environmentally friendly resource into brand new materials.', '[this car was made from trees! but it’s not out of their wood. scientists took only the toughest, strongest part of wood — its nanocrystals of cellulose — and added them to other materials. experts are hoping that this secret ingredient could allow us to use far less plastic., courtesy of ministry of the environment government, japan, by kathryn hulick, april 4, 2022 at 6:30 am, what happens when you smash a plastic bottle? it squishes. what about a glass bottle? it breaks. in engineering lingo, that means plastic is tough and glass is strong. most manufactured materials can be tough or strong — but not both, says abhinav rao. while working on his phd at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge, he helped create a new material that is both tough and strong., he and his colleagues describe how they did it in the march issue of cellulose., its main ingredient comes from trees. rao, now an engineer at lam research in eaton, ohio, was inspired to create this material “by looking at what nature has to teach us.”, all plants contain tiny, toothpick-like crystals in the walls of their cells. called cellulose nanocrystals, they give plants their structure and strength. and as their name implies, these crystals are super-tiny. you’d need to stack 500 of them to match the width of a human hair., engineers can process wood to remove all but those cellulose nanocrystals. “we’re breaking trees down into their smallest components,” explains emily cranston. a wood scientist, she did not take part in the new study. cranston works in canada at the university of british columbia in vancouver., once you’ve got a bunch of these nano toothpicks, the possibilities are nearly endless. “we can turn trees into lots of different cool things,” says cranston. the new work is part of a huge field, she notes, with hundreds of researchers. some are turning cellulose nanocrystals into parts for electronics. others are using them to make medical devices. still others are using them to clean water. a team in japan has even built an entire car out of materials that contain cellulose nanocrystals!, until rao’s team came along, though, the share of those nanocrystals in these new materials was very small (plastic tended to make up the rest). the reason they didn’t contain more, rao explains, is that the nanocrystals tend to clump. then their tiny toothpick shapes are lost — as is their incredible toughness and strength., weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment, thank you for signing up!, there was a problem signing you up., to increase the number of tiny toothpicks that could be packed together without clumping, rao’s team invented a new gel. it starts with a liquid that has some plastic and cellulose nanocrystals. “at that point, the cellulose is sitting at the bottom,” explains rao. next, the team vibrates the liquid using ultrasonic waves. this stirs in the nanocrystals. once everything is fully mixed, the liquid “freezes into a gel and stops moving,” says rao. the process is quick. “it happens in seconds.”, this gel is much stiffer than jell-o. you could turn a cup of it upside down and it wouldn’t pour out. but a 3d printer or a molding machine can put enough pressure on the gel to force it into new shapes. as a test, rao’s team crafted a tooth-shaped object from the gel. exposing this gel tooth to heat hardened it into a solid. the material also shrank a lot, but ended up as strong and tough as some types of bone.  , the properties come from the new material’s structure. a small amount of softer plastic surrounds each hard cellulose nanocrystal or small group of crystals, rao explains. so cracks can’t cut through the entire material. “the crack has to meander,” he says. since it must follow such a twisty path, any crack usually doesn’t make it very far. that keeps the material firm., by weight, more than 60 percent of the new material is cellulose nanocrystals. the rest is plastic. “that’s great,” says cranston. “there’s lots of tree in there.”, we will always need materials with certain properties, such as strength, toughness or durability. but there’s another property to think about, too, says rao — kindness to the planet. since cellulose nanocrystals come from trees, they are “greener” than plastic or most other synthetic materials., people know how to manage forests so that enough new trees are planted to replace all the harvested wood. it might also be possible to get the crystal toothpicks from algae or even bacteria. unlike plastic, which comes from fossil fuels, these cellulose bits are a nearly endless renewable resource., plastic also harms the environment when it fails to biodegrade. the cellulose crystals break down easily. however, a material that contains these crystals mixed with plastics may not break down or recycle easily, especially if it’s designed to be strong and tough. engineers, says cranston, must find a balance among all these important properties. with that in mind, she asks, “what would you build with an all-natural, nano-sized toothpick?”, this is one in a series presenting news on technology and innovation, made possible with generous support from the lemelson foundation., algae: single-celled organisms, once considered plants (they aren’t). as aquatic organisms, they grow in water. like green plants, they depend on sunlight to make their food., bacteria: (singular: bacterium) single-celled organisms. these dwell nearly everywhere on earth, from the bottom of the sea to inside other living organisms (such as plants and animals). bacteria are one of the three domains of life on earth., cellulose: a type of fiber found in plant cell walls. it is formed by chains of glucose molecules., crystal: (adj. crystalline) a solid consisting of a symmetrical, ordered, three-dimensional arrangement of atoms or molecules. it’s the organized structure taken by most minerals. apatite, for example, forms six-sided crystals. the mineral crystals that make up rock are usually too small to be seen with the unaided eye., electronics: devices that are powered by electricity but whose properties are controlled by the semiconductors or other circuitry that channel or gate the movement of electric charges., engineer: a person who uses science to solve problems. as a verb, to engineer means to design a device, material or process that will solve some problem or unmet need. (v.) to perform these tasks, or the name for a person who performs such tasks., environment: the sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest)., force: some outside influence that can change the motion of a body, hold bodies close to one another, or produce motion or stress in a stationary body., fossil fuel: any fuel — such as coal, petroleum (crude oil) or natural gas — that has developed within the earth over millions of years from the decayed remains of bacteria, plants or animals., gel: a gooey or viscous material that can flow like a thick liquid., meander: a bend in a stream or to move slowly and with no straight path in mind., plastic: any of a series of materials that are easily deformable; or synthetic materials that have been made from polymers (long strings of some building-block molecule) that tend to be lightweight, inexpensive and resistant to degradation. (adj.) a material that is able to adapt by changing shape or possibly even changing its function., pressure: force applied uniformly over a surface, measured as force per unit of area., recycle: to find new uses for something — or parts of something — that might otherwise be discarded or treated as waste., technology: the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry — or the devices, processes and systems that result from those efforts., vibrate: to rhythmically shake or to move continuously and rapidly back and forth., wave: a disturbance or variation

four. but when erik ten hag tunes into his own new club\'s game at the emirates on saturday, arsenal will offer a glimpse of a direction of travel. they, like united, have journeyed through the depths of a wild player acquisition policy - throwing the house at nicolas pepe, mesut ozil and pierre-emerick aubameyang. racking up a squad which 12 months ago was valued at £616milion, earned an average of £104,000 a week, and yet had managed just 35 goals in 27 matches. but they have emerged from the madness. three days ago, they won 4-2 at chelsea with a starting line-up which included six english players whose average age was 23 years and two months and who cost arsenal a collective £80m, including three of their own academy graduates. enough to make ten hag flinch when he considers the near £400m transfer fees lavished on a united team, including two graduates, humiliated at anfield., police sniffer dogs carried out urgent bomb searches at the cheshire mansion harry maguire (top) shares with fiancee fern hawkins (with maguire, bottom) and their two daughters, following the anonymous threat sent to his agent. the security team around the man united captain and england defender is also thought to have been beefed up. but the sun claim the 29-year-old was given a chilling ultimatum which gave him 72 hours to quit his club or have three bombs which had been planted at his house detonated. the report adds the centre-back was at united\'s carrington training ground when he was made aware of the sickening message on wednesday - a day after united had suffered a 4-0 defeat by liverpool - and consequently rushed home. his fiancee and daughters lillie saint, two, and piper rose, one next month, have gone to a safe house while maguire himself is staying with a team-mate, the report adds., chris wheeler: interim manager ralf rangnick confirmed pogba is set to miss the rest of the season and expects united\'s £89million record signing to leave for nothing when his contract runs out., exclusive interview by ian ladyman: rob page page has taken wales to euro 2020 and on the brink of a first world cup appearance despite being a caretaker manager., chris wheeler: much to

exclusive interview by riath al-samarrai: from white spots to yellow dots, the broken giant is drawing an awful line. for two hours he has been looking at his old life and the new, at what has gone and what might be next to go. he knows the robberies won\'t stop until there is nothing left to take. and so steve thompson sits for a while in silence in this lovely pub in cheshire. in his hand is his phone and a picture of what it all cost, which is why he is shaking that damaged head with the scars and mangled ears. \'look at this,\' he says, flicking to a top-down scan of his brain. \'the doctor said if you\'ve got a pinprick of yellow, that\'s a significant brain injury. whatever is yellow is dead.\', exclusive: channel 4 has won the battle to broadcast england\'s nations league

from 15 games at stamford bridge in the premier league this season, and have been well beaten in their last three home matches., no, it\'s not against anthony joshua (top right), or even oleksandr usyk - who dethroned the unified champion last year - but in dillian whyte (centre right), tyson fury (centre left) has a live opponent who carries a hell of a whack. after wiping out deontay wilder to conclusively end their bitter rivalry, fury understandably comes into the bout as the overwhelming favourite, with many a boxing buff believing the writing is already on the wall. his newly-formed come-forward style developed under the tutelage of trainer sugarhill steward could just be his downfall, others believe, however, with whyte\'s lethal left-hook primed and ready for any potential slip-ups. the general consensus is that fury could win either by stoppage or by a shutout points victory, while whyte will need a knockout if he\'s to be crowned the new wbc heavyweight champion of the world. here, sportsmail brings you all the big fight predictions from the sport\'s stellar names - including derek chisora (top left), john fury (bottom right) and david haye (bottom left) - ahead of saturday night\'s enticing showdown., lennox lewis believes \'there\'s only one fighter\' who can defeat the gypsy king. \'i\'ll tell you who that is,\' says the great brit who is still the last undisputed world heavyweight champion., johnny nelson: the waiting is almost over. tyson fury and dillian whyte clash for the wbc world heavyweight title in an eagerly-anticipated showdown at wembley stadium., jeff powell at wembley: tyson fury joked he planned to \'eat burgers and drink beers\' in his final 24 hours before going head-to-head with dillian whyte, after weighing in significantly lighter than expected at friday\'s weigh-in. the gypsy king has vowed to come in a career-heaviest for his british blockbuster against whyte on saturday, but instead tipped the scales nearly a stone lighter than for his trilogy bout against deontay wilder. fury is making his long-awaited uk homecoming after fighting stateside for the best part of four years, as a hungry whyte finally gets his shot at the wbc belt. a slimline fury tipped the scales at 264lbs 13oz, while \'the body snatcher\' put on 6lbs to come in at 253lbs and 4oz as the pair got one final opportunity to size each other up

from now - it will be some sight, not only for everton but for a city hungry for the post-pandemic investment that will come as part of the regeneration package. the worry, though, is what division everton will be playing their football in when they get to their new home. everton play at liverpool on sunday afternoon and if burnley take anything from their earlier game with wolves at turf moor, frank lampard\'s team will be in the bottom three of the premier league at kick-off. liverpool feels like a city that needs both its clubs, both in terms of its economy and maybe to a degree its self-esteem., chelsea will take on liverpool at 4.45pm on saturday, may 14, with chelsea women facing manchester city women the following day at 2.30pm., former city, liverpool and bayern munich

southampton thanks to dwight mcneil\'s final touch of the ball before he was substituted., the initial reaction from some at anfield, who have been around the game for years, to thiago alcantara\'s display against manchester united was limited to three words: \'oh my god.\', mejbri came on as a substitute in the 84th minute of his side\'s 4-0 defeat on tuesday. he was quickly booked for an overzealous tackle, almost cautioned again for another attempt., micah richards: the first time i saw sadio mane was during one of the proudest days of my career. at the 2012 olympic games, i was part of great britain\'s football team and we played senegal in our opening group game. mane was at metz 10 years ago. he was fresh to international football, a little erratic and still had much to learn - but you could see he was a talent. as a squad, we assumed we\'d take care of senegal that day at old trafford but the way he played - full of aggression and energy - embodied his team as a whole. i came away from the stadium believing i\'d seen young forward with a bright future, an opinion i also held about idrissa gana gueye, who was a tiger in midfield. they were two standouts, helping senegal secure a deserved 1-1 draw, and i felt if they got an opportunity at the right club, they would go far. the last time i saw sadio mane was seven days ago at wembley stadium. i was working

minutes of united\'s 4-0 defeat to liverpool on tuesday night., the dutchman was confirmed as united\'s next permanent manager on thursday and will replace interim boss ralf rangnick after agreeing a contract until 2025 worth £9million per year. the 52-year-old will inherit a squad full of high-profile stars such as cristiano ronaldo at old trafford next season, a marked difference from his current stint as ajax boss. but speaking to dutch newspaper trouw the day after being announced as ole gunnar solskjaer\'s permanent replacement, ten hag has vowed to challenge those who are not deemed to be pulling their weight, regardless of their name and status., with the deadline for final offers up, there are just days remaining before the future owners at stamford bridge are expected

leclerc says he\'s \'fully focused\' on the emilia romagna grand prix this weekend despite recently being a victim of robbery. , the premier league relegation battle is now officially too close to

decline at england\'s biggest club following sir alex ferguson\'s retirement. the fact ten hag will be united\'s fifth permanent manager since 2013 only underlines the dysfunction that has followed the dynasty of success and silverware achieved by ferguson. so, realistically, how long will it be until ten hag is expected to deliver success. first season? two to three years? four or five? in the aftermath of the ten hag appointment, former players and pundits were divided on what the expectations should be., ahead of his side\'s london derby against west ham, also at their home ground, tuchel

year, international women’s day is celebrated across the globe to recognize women’s rights and gender equality. this year’s observance encouraged all people to #breakthebias and envision a world that values and celebrates diversity., bias results from the complex interplay of experience, cognition, learning, and stigmatization. it shapes the way people make decisions and influences one’s appraisal of what constitutes good and bad. bias can sometimes be helpful as it provides a quick way to motivate social discourse. however, bias often leads to unfair or discriminatory treatment. the most insidious aspect of bias is that it frequently happens outside of one’s conscious awareness. the only effective way to disrupt the dangerous influence of bias is to persistently raise awareness, challenge assumptions, and enrich the visual cues around the world that highlight the unique and powerful differences between people. placing oneself in groups and teams with others who are different from ourselves is one starting point., i’ve been inspired by a phrase i’ve heard several times recently: you can’t be what you can’t see. this phrase is often used to identify the multiplicative impact of creating a diverse workforce. this is pretty inspirational to me! i have often experienced efforts to bring women into leadership positions or to open scientific opportunities to people of color as a strategy that served the individual person — which in itself has many benefits. for the individual, expanded career opportunities provide meaningful work and the opportunity, not only to use one’s talents to advance an enterprise mission, but also gain financial rewards. the teams surrounding these individuals benefits too. making sure that leadership teams are comprised of people of different genders and who have different life experiences improves our collective thought and creativity. it is important to recognize that these benefits do not arise solely because teams are made up of people who look different or sound different from each other but requires the intentional application of managerial actions that celebrate differences and help individuals build bridges between ways of knowing., the secretary of the smithsonian institution, lonnie g. bunch iii, attributed this quote to sally ride in an article he wrote about the opening of the sally ride exhibit for a smithsonian magazine article titled how the smithsonian is honoring remarkable american women. in his words, the presence of women in the space force not only benefited dr. ride and her crew but also served as a visible symbol to everyone, particularly girls and young women, that there were people who looked like them enjoying fulfilling careers in space., true appreciation of the diversity of people requires that we look beyond their physical characteristics to see their real uniqueness. one’s culture, family customs, language, and upbringing imbue individuals with mannerisms, mental models, and motivations, few of which have any physical manifestation. so, if we want to enrich our work groups with colleagues with differences in the cadence of speech or adherence to traditions, we will have to find a way to make those aspects visible, and in turn, engaging for all., jeff reznick and ken koyle, respectively the chief and deputy chief of nlm’s history of medicine division, published a free visual history of nlm and its beautiful buildings. in a brief video featuring some of the pictures from their book, you can take a tour of nlm’s nearly 200-year history. what’s important to pay attention to as you view these amazing images is the early and persistent commitment to creating a diverse workforce evidenced though the pictures of people present throughout the modern history of nlm., as nlm prepares its plan to join with the rest of the nih to dismantle structural racism and make the nih a welcoming workplace for people of all racial identities and ethnic heritages, looking back helps us understand that what we could see in our history allowed us to be in our future — may we continue to grow as a welcoming workplace serving scientists and society., guest post by griffin p. rodgers, md, macp, director of the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk) at nih. dr. rodgers hosts the weekly healthy moments radio broadcast, that offers tips to audiences on how to prevent and manage the various diseases within niddk’s mission., if a loved one tells you that you’re perfect, you can probably spot the potential bias quickly, right? identifying a trusted source isn’t as easy when you’re trying to find information on the internet., having access to a wide variety of health information online has changed the way people seek information and make decisions about their well-being. with so many websites and apps providing health content, how can you determine what source of information and content is trustworthy and accurate? this can be difficult., as the largest funder of investigator-initiated and peer-reviewed medical research, nih is a good place to start your search for reliable health information. communicating what we learn from our extensive medical research is at the heart of the health information you will find on the niddk website. our research areas include:, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease (ckd) are chronic diseases that are connected and affect many people. our free health information is informed by the research we fund and conduct to find better ways to prevent, treat, and cure diseases., a landmark niddk-supported study called the diabetes prevention program (dpp) and diabetes prevention program outcomes study (dppos) has helped us provide tips about how to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes, use diabetes medicines including metformin, and how to avoid or manage the array of health problems related to diabetes., our type 1 diabetes health information includes findings from the niddk-funded diabetes control and complications trial and a follow-up study, that together showed keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible slows the onset and progression of kidney, eye, and nerve damage caused by type 1 diabetes., we also shared what we learned studying weight-loss (bariatric) surgery in adults and youth in content about weight-loss surgery. the longitudinal assessment of bariatric surgery (labs) and teen-labs studies advanced our understanding of the risks and benefits of weight-loss surgery in adults and adolescents who have obesity. we are still studying the long-term health outcomes after surgery., kidney research supported through our chronic renal insufficiency cohort (cric) study has guided the development of health information about factors that cause ckd to worsen in adults or increase a person’s risk for cardiovascular disease. niddk, along with other nih institutes, also supports the chronic kidney disease in children (ckid) study, which has helped us understand the causes of ckd in children and how it affects a child’s health and development. niddk’s health information about kidney disease in children offers parents, caregivers, and youth an overview of kidney disease and how to treat it., another example of how we translate research discoveries into health information for the public is niddk’s research on viral hepatitis, which led to the development of many of the liver topics in our health information pages. niddk funded and conducted liver studies have led to the discovery of the hepatitis b virus, a vaccine for hepatitis b, improved treatments for hepatitis b and c. you can also find information about many diseases and disorders that are less common, but can have a profound impact on the people affected, such as zollinger-ellison syndrome., we offer health information in english and spanish. to help ensure that our audiences can easily find, read, and use our information, we review the content for scientific and clinical accuracy and plain language. to reach people where they are, we also make our health information available through medlineplus connect, a free service of nih’s national library of medicine (nlm), which links electronic health record systems and patient portals to nih information., niddk continues its mission to combat disease and disseminate health information anchored in our research to improve public health. i invite you to visit the niddk website to learn more about our research and to read and share our health information., in february, dr. brennan was a guest on dr. rodgers’ healthy moments. here are the featured topics:, dr. rodgers has served as niddk director since 2007. as a research investigator, he is widely recognized for his contributions to the development of the first effective therapy for sickle cell anemia. dr. rodgers serves as a chair, co-chair, and member of numerous high-level trans-nih and department of health and human services scientific and administrative committees, including the nih common fund program, “nutrition for precision health,” powered by the all of us research program, the nih obesity research task force, and the accelerating medicines partnership., guest post by meryl sufian, phd, chief program officer, nih national library of medicine (nlm) division of extramural programs., biomedical informatics and data science are exciting fields with careers that are in great demand and will continue to grow. as these areas of research have expanded, it is clear that individuals from racial and ethnic minorities and women are underrepresented. a diverse and inclusive workforce provides many benefits to advance science and discovery, such as robust learning environments, public trust in research, and incentives for encouraging underserved populations to participate in and benefit from health research., the nih research education program (r25) supports research educational activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas of the nih institutes and centers. nlm recently announced rfa-lm-22-001 (short-term research education experiences to attract talented students to biomedical informatics/data science careers and enhance diversity [r25 clinical trial not allowed]). this funding opportunity seeks proposals from institutions interested in creating educational programs and research experiences that will recruit talented students from diverse backgrounds to pursue degrees in biomedical informatics and data science., please join us on april 13 at 11 am et for a technical assistance webinar. applications are due by may 31, and full details about the r25 funding opportunity are available at rfa-lm-22-001., encouraging diversity remains an ongoing challenge that must be examined at every level of the educational pipeline. nlm’s new r25 program addresses this issue, in particular the transition from undergraduate to graduate education where science and engineering students from underrepresented groups tend to leave the research enterprise. at the postsecondary level, students need exposure to opportunities and role models in fields that require computational ability. the r25 program will provide students with experience in cutting edge biomedical informatics and data science research, offer enriching mentorship experiences, and prepare students to enter doctoral programs in these fields., increasing diversity in the biomedical and data science workforce is complex and requires expanding opportunities in primary and secondary education, awareness, and access to mentorships. nlm is optimistic that the r25 initiative is a good first step to address the diversity and pipeline issues, and more importantly, that you will join us in this endeavor. nlm welcomes applications from institutions and organizations who will provide a supportive environment and are committed to increasing the diversity of the biomedical informatics and data science workforce., dr. sufian joined the nlm in 2021 and most recently served as a senior science advisor to the director at the nih office of aids research. prior to this position, dr. sufian held various programmatic positions across nih including as a senior program director for the national institute on minority health and health disparities and program director at the national center for advancing translational sciences. her first position at nih was as a program director for the national cancer institute where she managed and provided oversight for the evaluation of research initiatives, one of my favorite books is the first of c.s. lewis’ chronicles of narnia, the lion, the witch and the wardrobe. this book talks about the forest re-awakening to greet a new world, and names are returned to all creatures of the forest., this is particularly relevant to nlm, where we employ health data standards to ensure that experiences related to health and illness have trustable and commonly used terms that allow health information in one context to be easily communicated in another… think of helping the clinicians at a receiving hospital understand the health concerns of a patient that is being transferred from a different facility., but that’s not what this story is about – it’s about bringing the people who create these health data standards, and those who use them, back to work! really, we’ve never been away from work. i am incredibly proud of the fact that nlm staff have continued to bring our valuable services and offerings to all those who need them despite being on a maximum telework status. each month when we meet for our all-staff virtual nlm town hall meetings, i start by thanking our staff for their efforts to make sure that our valuable nlm resources remain available to the public., now, following the second anniversary of the covid-19 pandemic, we are getting ready to return to the physical workspace. between now and early may, we will be returning most of our nlm staff to the physical workspace.  , what does this mean? well, i will give you a sneak peek… since last december, five members of our nlm leadership team have been going into the physical workspace. i asked these colleagues to commit to coming into the office for 5 hours every tuesday. so, around 9:30 am every tuesday, we (me, our deputy director, executive officer, acting scientific director, and operations coordinator), properly masked and distanced, meet in the executive conference room. i have to say that there is a peculiar delight in us all being together! for the remainder of the day, we all work safely in our offices, gathering as appropriate for meetings among the five of us or across our entire leadership team using virtual platforms!, over the next few weeks, we will be inviting the rest of nlm staff back to the physical workspace, but it won’t be to the way it used to be. we will be learning together about the future of work., our leadership team has been hard at work examining the functional statements of each division and evaluating how each division meets it mission to contribute to nlm’s greater mission and vision. our leadership team is working to decide how every position contributes to the nlm vision, and to determine how much flexibility, in location and working hours, may be afforded to each position and to the working groups in which those positions are situated. following this, our directors will work with their supervisors and managers to engage with each staff member to create the best arrangement that advances the nlm mission in a manner that is fair to everyone and affords the maximum feasible workplace flexibilities for all. , come along with us as we define the new normal – the nlm of the future! i have commissioned the nlm future of work working group to help us envision what the professional world will become to ensure that nlm continues to serve scientists and society. how can we serve you?, guest post by robert pines, ms, writer/editor, and sarah ashley jolly, mph, writer/editor and graphic designer (contractor), nih national library of medicine (nlm) office of communications and public liaison., this week marks both national library week (april 3-9) and national public health week (april 4-10) and we are pleased to recognize this intersection of nlm’s work. while the importance of each observance on its own is clear, their connection may not be as obvious. from our vantage point in the nlm communications office, however, we see the many roles in which nlm staff members and contractors are engaged, and how libraries and public health are linked to create a healthier world. as such, we are pleased to share just how nlm embodies this overlap in observances as a center for information innovation that supports and advances public health., nlm is the world’s largest biomedical library and engaged in activities as diverse as our global community of users. nlm staff members and contractors are motivated by a desire to serve scientists and society, and are involved with training, community engagement, literacy campaigns, information dissemination, and more. public health is at the core of nlm’s mission, and it drives the work we do as a library that delivers information directly to stakeholders., “…to assist the advancement of medical and related sciences and to aid the dissemination and exchange of scientific and other information important to the progress of medicine and to the public health.” -nlm authorizing language, inspired by many of the daily themes of national public health week, we spoke with six colleagues representing different parts of nlm to hear — in their own words — how their work in a library contributes to public health., “nlm has been an active participant in the nih-wide unite initiative, which seeks to identify and address structural racism within the nih-supported and broader scientific community. we’ve worked to recruit change agents from across nlm to advance racial and ethnic equity through a commitment to reform our own policies, practice, and procedures. this effort is rooted in a recognition that we have a responsibility to serve as exemplars for the change we wish to see.” maryam zaringhalam, phd data science and open science officer, nlm office of strategic initiatives, learn about the nih unite initiative and diversity at nlm., “trainees who come to nlm have a passion for advancing healthcare, and we provide an environment where they can apply their unique computational skillsets to address public health questions. among other contributions, their work here has improved our understanding of different diseases and created systems that help other researchers and clinicians better serve their patients.” virginia meyer, phd training coordinator, nlm intramural research program (contractor), view training opportunities at nlm., “nlm cultivates long-term partnerships with communities to help address challenges and opportunities around health equity and information access. for over 30 years, for example, the environmental health information partnership (enhip) has enhanced the capacity of minority-serving academic institutions to engage with environmental health information. enhip has had a great impact with almost 150 community-based projects focused on awareness and usage of nlm resources.” amanda j. wilson  chief, nlm office of engagement and training, read about the nlm office of engagement and training and its work with enhip., “the network of the national library of medicine (nnlm) is committed to providing equitable access to high-quality health information. we make nlm tools and resources available to those who need them in order to build a knowledgeable, resilient health care workforce and public. through nnlm’s work, individuals are able to make informed decisions about their health, research and public health professionals have the resources they need to make change, and the public health of the nation is improved as a result.” martha meacham, mlis, ma project director, nlm office of engagement and training, discover the work of nnlm., “at medlineplus en español, our team of translators facilitates access to content from nlm using thoughtful translations that consider the breadth and variability of spanish-speaking audiences. we are proud to enable access to high-quality health information by reducing language barriers and bridging cultural gaps so consumers can make informed health decisions.” javier chavez  team lead, medlineplus en español, explore medlineplus and medlineplus en español., “accessibility is critical to closing the health equity gap. nlm promotes accessibility by ensuring nlm’s videos include audio description, captions, and proper color contrast so that blind, sight-impaired, or deaf audiences can find and learn about nlm’s various tools and resources.” andrew wiley  video producer, nlm office of communications and public liaison (contractor), watch our audio described videos and read about accessibility at nlm., as echoed in the words of our colleagues, nlm staff members and contractors are dedicated to providing stakeholders with the resources and information needed to

will sign an', '[the white house 1600 pennsylvania ave nw washington, dc 20500, new actions will protect against wildfire threats, support local economies, and reduce climate pollution, today, on earth day, president biden will sign an executive order to expand his administration’s historic and bold efforts to tackle the climate crisis, make our nation more resilient to extreme weather, and strengthen local economies. the president will sign the executive order in seattle, washington—rounding out a trip across the west focused on lowering costs for families and protecting communities from intensifying climate impacts. wildfires and extreme weather events are growing in frequency and ferocity, engulfing communities in the west and across the country and costing lives, homes, and money. because president biden knows the cost of inaction is too great, he is taking bold executive action and reaffirming his calls on congress to address the climate crisis.  , america’s forests are a key climate solution, absorbing carbon dioxide equivalent to more than 10% of u.s. annual greenhouse gas emissions. federal lands are home to many of the nation’s mature and old-growth forests, which serve as critical carbon sinks, cherished landscapes, and unique habitats. however, these magnificent ecosystems are threatened by the climate impacts that are already here, with intensifying wildfires demanding urgent action to protect our forests and the economies that depend on them. the bipartisan infrastructure law provides historic wildfire resilience funding and calls for prioritizing the restoration of old-growth forests., building on this directive and the administration’s commitment to climate-smart forest stewardship, today’s executive order will:, across these efforts, the administration will leverage historic investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law and the fy 2022 budget, and work in partnership with states, tribal nations, communities, industry, ngos, labor, scientists, and private landowners, to strengthen our forests while creating good-paying jobs., today’s executive order will advance the biden-harris administration’s climate goals and economic agenda by:, reducing wildfire risk, under president biden’s leadership, the u.s. department of agriculture’s (usda) forest service has developed a 10-year strategy to reduce wildfire risk through science-based fuels and forest health treatments, with a goal of treating an additional 50 million acres across federal and non-federal lands. the department of the interior (doi) has also developed a 5-year plan for monitoring, maintenance, and treatment efforts focused on fire-prone interior and tribal lands., as a critical down payment, the bipartisan infrastructure law provides $8 billion to fund forest and land management activities, and the fy 2022 omnibus provides $5.7 billion for wildland fire management and related risk mitigation and research. usda and doi are mobilizing $5 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law for hazardous fuels reduction and other mitigation programs, such as a $1 billion community wildfire defense grant program and $600 million for firefighter pay—providing about 1,500 additional firefighters and supporting the president’s commitment that no federal firefighter will make less than $15 an hour. already, usda has announced $131 million this year for wildfire risk reduction treatments in high-risk landscapes in washington, oregon, california, idaho, montana, colorado, new mexico, and arizona., the bipartisan infrastructure law directs doi and usda to specifically prioritize the restoration of old-growth forests, taking into consideration their contributions to landscape fire adaptation. however, there is currently no inventory that identifies the location and condition of mature and old-growth stands., to strengthen america’s forests and advance a holistic, science-based approach to wildfire resilience and forest restoration, this executive order advances action on:  , going forward, the administration will work with congress to secure additional resources, by requesting $6.1 billion for wildfire risk reduction in the president’s fy 2023 budget and continuing to pursue historic climate resilience investments in additional legislation., strengthening forests for thriving local economies, america’s forests provide millions of jobs and underpin local economies, particularly in rural communities. the biden-harris administration is mobilizing historic resources to help these forests and communities thrive. for example, the administration’s building a better america rural infrastructure tour is highlighting wide-ranging support for healthy forest economies, including: planning assistance to boost outdoor recreation economies; support for tribes, local governments, and conservation non-profits to establish community forests that create jobs; and grants to expand markets for innovative wood products and wood energy that support sustainable forest management., through the fy 2022 omnibus, the administration is also investing $162 million in cooperative forestry programs across state, municipal, and privately-owned forest landscapes. additionally, the bipartisan infrastructure law significantly expands reforestation projects on national forest land—enough to plant an estimated 1.2 billion trees and sequester 75 million metric tons of carbon, all while supporting thousands of jobs., the executive order will build on these efforts by advancing:, combatting global deforestation, president biden has committed to help deliver on global goals to end natural forest loss by 2030, while restoring at least an additional 200 million hectares of forests and other ecosystems. at the cop26 international climate conference, president biden announced the “plan to conserve global forests: critical carbon sinks”—harnessing u.s. diplomatic, policy, and financing tools, in partnership with other countries, indigenous and local forest communities, the private sector, and civil society, and with a focus on three critical areas of global importance: the amazon, congo, and southeast asian forests. , to further advance these efforts and achieve the president’s international commitments, this executive order directs the department of state, in coordination with other agencies, to prepare reports to the president on whole-of-government approaches to stopping global deforestation and restoring lands, including:, enlisting nature in the fight against climate change, the biden-harris administration has led the way on enhancing nature’s ability to support the health, wellbeing, and economic security of all americans. president biden launched the america the beautiful initiative to support his goal of conserving at least 30 percent of u.s. lands and waters by 2030. interagency working groups reporting to the national climate task force are exploring nature-based solutions to address extreme heat, drought, wildfire, flood, and coastal threats. the administration is also recognizing the value of and elevating indigenous traditional ecological knowledge across federal scientific and policy processes. the president’s bipartisan infrastructure law provides—as part of over $50 billion in historic resilience investments—funding for nature-based solutions, including $2.3 billion for the forest service and interior to advance ecosystem restoration and resilience., to facilitate use of these and other resources, today the national climate task force’s coastal resilience interagency working group, co-led by the white house council on environmental quality and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, is releasing a compendium of federal nature-based solutions for coastal communities, states, tribes, and territories—streamlining access to more than 100 information resources and 48 federal programs that can support nature-based solutions in coastal areas.  , to further amplify the power of nature, including its ability to absorb climate pollution and increase resilience in all communities, today’s executive order calls for the following:, we\'ll be in touch with the latest information on how president biden and his administration are working for the american people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our

publicly available in a year and will establish consistent definitions, accounting for regional and ecological variation. the agencies will then analyze threats facing these forests, including from wildfires and other climate impacts., climate-smart stewardship: after completing the inventory, doi and usda will develop new policies, with robust opportunity for public comment, to institutionalize climate-smart management and conservation strategies that address the threats facing mature and old-growth forests on federal lands., enhanced coordination: doi and usda will partner with other federal agencies, states, tribal nations, and any interested private landowners to better coordinate conservation and wildfire risk reduction efforts—leveraging investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law and other sources., economic opportunities in outdoor recreation and sustainable forest products: the departments of agriculture, commerce, and the interior will work with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as the private sector, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, and the scientific community, to advance forest-related economic opportunities at the local and regional levels. these community-led opportunities will create and sustain jobs in outdoor recreation and in sustainable wood, paper, and other forest products, while supporting healthy, sustainably managed forests in timber communities., reforestation partnerships: the administration will develop agency-specific 2030 targets for reforestation, including the use of partnerships to advance these goals beyond federal lands to enable our future forests to be more resilient to climate change and wildfire, while also supporting healthy forest economies for years to come., expanding seed and nursery capacity: usda and doi will address a longstanding seed shortfall by developing a plan, in partnership with states, tribes, and the private sector, to boost federal cone and seed collection and seedling nursery capacity. these actions will support tree-planting efforts by a range of public and private partners. expanding seed and nursery capacity is especially important for timberlands in the west that have been devastated by wildfire and need to be re-planted., combat commodity-driven deforestation: a major driver of global deforestation is forest clearing to produce agricultural commodities like beef, soy, and palm oil. to combat those practices, the department of state will lead development of a report on whole-of-government approaches to reduce or eliminate u.s. purchases of agricultural commodities grown on illegally or recently deforested lands, including through public-private partnerships to incentivize sustainable sourcing. these efforts will not only protect forests and human rights abroad, but also provide a level playing field for responsible agricultural producers at home., support sustainable forest management around the world: the department of state will coordinate with other agencies to assess the broader use of foreign assistance, trade tools, finance, and international partnerships to combat deforestation and support sustainable forest management around the world, with special attention to the critical role played by indigenous peoples and local communities and landholders in conserving and restoring forests., report on nature-based solutions: as reaffirmed this year by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, nature-based solutions will play a key role in achieving net-zero emissions and building resilience to climate impacts. building on ongoing efforts, the white house council on environmental quality, office of science and technology policy (ostp), and office of domestic climate policy will work with agencies to develop a report to the national climate task force on key opportunities for greater deployment of nature-based solutions—everything from restoring marshes, to planting shade trees, to promoting drought-resistant crops., guidance on valuing nature: the office of management and budget will issue valuation guidance to help agencies better account for services provided by ecosystems and the environment (such as pollinators supporting our crops, or forests cleaning our air and water). in support, ostp and the department of commerce will continue leading an interagency initiative to improve and update baseline information on the economic value of our existing natural assets and new nature-based solutions. , first u.s. national nature assessment: the united states lacks comprehensive knowledge of the state of our nation’s lands, waters, and wildlife and the specific benefits that they provide. to create this comprehensive picture, the 13-agency u.s. global change research program will develop the first-ever assessment of the condition of nature within the united states. the assessment will also allow us to look ahead at how nature might change in the future and identify opportunities for investments in nature to help achieve our climate, health, environmental justice, and economic goals., share this page on facebook, share this page on twitter,

to get in touch with the national archives and give them the name and tribe and birthdate of an individual and we would look the name up on the indian census rolls. we don’t do that anymore; we don’t do genealogy for people anymore, because now it is online and you can do it yourself.,  , there is no database of names of everybody who was indian. the bia only kept records of tribes that were under their supervision (that is what “federally recognized” means).  for many years the bia did not keep a list of names of everybody in a tribe either, or take censuses, unless there was a matter of removal, moving people around.  in 1885, the commissioner of indian affairs sent out a circular to all the agents telling them for now on, they needed to compile an actual census of everybody under their supervision. so from about 1885, to about 1940, there are census rolls that give the names and sex and ages and family relationships and even blood quantum for all those who were living with tribes that were under the supervision of the bia.,  , if you think you had an ancestor who might be on those rolls, you can look them up yourself. the indian census rolls are on both fold3.com and ancestry.com. you pay a small fee but it is worth it. in the past, you had to know ahead of time what tribe somebody was in because there were 692 reels of microfilm to look through and you had to start somewhere. now that they are digitized you can simply put in a name. if you come to one of our facilities you can use our computers to do this for free.,  , to search the indian census rolls:,  , go to http://www.fold3.com/institution-index.php select all titles, and choose indian census rolls. these are the censuses of all the tribes except the five civilized tribes, from about 1885 to 1940. they do not include everyone who was an indian, only those living on the reservations.  you have a choice of putting a name, or you can click on browse, choose the tribe and search individual rolls yourself. you can check out all their possibilities for the names, and see if any seem to be your relatives. finding someone on the indian census rolls does not entitle you to membership in an indian tribe. you have to get in touch with the tribe and find out what the membership rules are and what documentation they want from you.,  , or you can go to ancestry.com and put in a name to search their copies of various native american rolls,   http://search.ancestryinstitution.com/search/group/nativeamerican, find us indian census rolls. you can put in a name and see the results., you can also search the regular census records on ancestry.,  , finding an ancestor on one of the rolls may help you figure out what tribe your ancestor came from. but you must get in touch with the tribe for membership. they are the ones who determine if you meet their requirements for eligibility and they are the ones who will decide about membership, and issue you a card if they accept you. the government has nothing to do with this, and does not issue any cards.,  , if you do not find your ancestor on one of these rolls, there probably are not any federal records of them as an indian. people who left their tribes and lived in the general public were just like other citizens. the best way to research them may be to start with the regular census records, and other local records. sometimes the federal decennial census may list someone as in, for indian, but they do not identify the tribe. there are a few federal decennial censuses that do list some tribal members, and a good place to find out about that would be our pages about indians in the census, https://www.archives.gov/research/census/native-americans/1790-1930.html, https://www.archives.gov/research/census/native-americans/census-bureau.html,  , and for other information on researching indian ancestors, check our page,

in the past, the mighty currents at the bottom of the ocean became stronger, and it seems something similar is happening again, which c', '[warm surface currents determine the climate of many parts of the world, for example keeping northern europe temperate compared to anywhere else at similar latitudes. however, much further down there are also cold currents, and the forces that determine their strength are much more poorly known. image credit: nasa/jpl, kilometers beneath the ocean\'s surface, immense currents redistribute water and heat between the ocean basins. by examining the geological record to determine how these currents have changed since the dinosaurs\' days, scientists have shed light on one of the big outstanding climate questions: will higher temperatures at the surface change deep-sea flows?, vast amounts of research have been done on how increasing greenhouse gasses are changing atmospheric behavior, and there has been plenty of work done on the consequences for the upper layers of the ocean. the depths, however, are much harder to study, and we lack baseline research on how things were operating even a few decades ago., dr adriana dutkiewicz and professor dietmar müller of the university of sydney have looked much further back to fill in the gap. in geology, dutkiewicz and müller show that great deep-sea currents have sped up during warm eras, suggesting this is something we can expect to see again., \"so far, the ocean has absorbed a quarter of anthropogenic co2 and over 90 percent of the associated excess heat,\" dutkiewicz said in a statement., however, we know relatively little about how the consequences at depth. \"the satellite data typically used to inform ocean models only cover a few decades, leading to a poor understanding of longer-term ocean variability,” dutkiewicz added. , dutkiewicz and müller looked at the accumulation of plankton seashells at 293 sites on submerged continental shelves and in the deep ocean over the last 66 million years. they focused on hiatuses that occur when currents are strong enough to sweep away material that would otherwise build up., with the sites widely dispersed, simultaneous hiatuses at many locations indicate speeding up of the deep currents, rather than more local factors. some of the observations could be tied to well-known events, such as the widening of the drake passage and the space between tasmania and antarctica, which allowed the formation of the antarctic circumpolar current a little over 30 million years ago., most immediately relevant, however, is that deep ocean hiatuses have decreased over the last 13 million years, as the earth entered a long-term cooling phase. this indicates abyssal currents have slowed down over that time. nevertheless, dutkiewicz and müller were able to detect spikes during this phase indicating more rapid current movement, coinciding with known warm periods., the more recent data is also more reliable because most sites are included in this period, while only a few drill holes go back to the earliest part of the study., the paper postulates the increase in currents during warm periods is caused by stronger winds blowing over surface waters at this time, and by reduced ocean stratification., “fast-forward to today, independent studies using satellite data suggest that large-scale ocean circulation and ocean eddies have become more intense over the last two to three decades of global warming, supporting our results\", müller said. , with an expectation that ocean circulation will gain strength, climatologists will be able to sharpen their predictions for how higher global temperatures will affect local climates. other studies have revealed warmer, better mixed oceans are generally more productive and better at storing carbon. consequently, the speeding up dutkiewicz and müller predict could provide considerable benefits, although whether they will come fast enough to make much difference for us in unclear. \"these processes so complex, combining the physics and chemistry of the oceans even the most complex ocean atmosphere models can\'t capture everything, which is why we are looking further back in time,\" müller told iflscience. ,  , sign up today to get weekly science coverage direct to your inbox, this website uses cookies, this website uses cookies to

map is loaded by default, and loads the map as a grid of pixel-based raster image tiles, which are generated by google maps platform server-side, then served to your web app. the vector map is a composed of vector-based tiles, which are drawn at load time on the client-side using webgl, a web technology that allows the browser to access the gpu on the user\'s device to render 2d and 3d graphics., the vector map is the same google map your users are familiar with using, and offers a number of advantages over the default raster tile map, most notably the sharpness of vector-based images, and the addition of 3d buildings at close zoom levels. the vector map also supports some new features, such as the ability to add 3d content with webgl overlay view, programmatic tilt and heading control, enhanced camera control, and fractional zoom for smoother zooming., get started with vector maps, use the map.movecamera() function to update any combination of camera properties at once. map.movecamera() accepts a single parameter containing all of the camera properties to update. the following example shows calling map.movecamera() to set center, zoom, heading, and tilt at once:, you can animate camera properties by calling map.movecamera() with an animation loop, as shown here:, vector maps support fractional zoom, which lets you zoom using fractional values instead of integers. while both raster and vector maps support fractional zoom, fractional zoom is on by default for vector maps, and off by default for raster maps. use the isfractionalzoomenabled map option to turn fractional zoom on and off., the following example shows enabling fractional zoom when initializing the map:, you can also turn fractional zoom on and off by setting the isfractionalzoomenabled

07:05:42', 1, 'WWII Military Unit Records at the National Archives - An Introduction  This post provides a brief overview of some of the predominant series of World War', '[wwii military unit records at the national archives - an introduction,  , this post provides a brief overview of some of the predominant series of world war ii operational unit records in the custody of the national archives and records administration (nara). unit records are useful if you would like to learn more about a unit’s movements and operations. the national archives does not have custody of unit records for every military unit, and the volume and type of records can vary considerably by unit. we also tend to have more records for higher-echelon units and fewer for lower-level units.,  , although there are a few exceptions (e.g. muster rolls and personnel diaries), typically unit records contain little or no information regarding individuals’ service and we do not have a name index to the unit records. if you are researching the military service of a specific individual, we suggest you start by requesting their military personnel records. the locations of military personnel records depend on the branch of service and time period -- nara’s locations of service records website provides a handy chart, which can help you determine where the personnel records you seek are located and instructions about how to request them.,  , each branch of the military kept different types of unit records, and these records are dispersed throughout various record groups and series at nara. each record group comprises the records of a major government entity (e.g. a bureau or an independent agency). while army and navy records for the world war ii period are dispersed across a number of record groups, smaller branches like the marine corps, army air forces, and coast guard, are generally limited to a single record group each for the wwii period. within each record group, records are divided into numbered series or “entries,” which are grouped based on the creating office and type of record. some record groups have thousands of entries, so it can be daunting to try to figure out the best place to start. this post highlights and describes the primary series of world war ii unit records in nara’s custody for each branch of service, with links to the series descriptions in the national archives catalog where available. if you have additional questions after reviewing this post, we encourage you to contact the reference staff at the nara location that has custody of the records you are interested in.,  , army:, the textual reference archives ii branch at the national archives at college park, maryland, has custody of several series of records related to world war ii army units:,  , the main series of wwii army unit records is the world war ii operations reports, 1940-1948 in records of the adjutant general\'s office, 1917- (record group 407). these records consist mostly of unit historical reports, after action reports, unit journals, and general orders. generally, the files do not include any personnel or medical information. the records are arranged according to an alphanumeric filing system based on military hierarchy. a paper file list index for this series is available at the national archives. the records are not yet described at the file-unit level in the national archives catalog, but you may request a search of the records by e-mailing the reference staff at archives2reference@nara.gov. be sure to include the unit(s) and date(s) of interest.,  , another large series that contains wwii army unit records is unit histories, 1943-1967 in records of u.s. army operational, tactical, and support organizations (world war ii and thereafter) (record group 338). this series consists of the files of division-level organic and non-organic us army units. division files usually include historical reports, general orders, directives, journals, memos, circulars, bulletins, and policy records. records of organic units (units that were permanently attached to a division) typically contain unit histories, general orders, and other administrative records. records of non-organic units (units not permanently attached to a division) generally consist of historical reports and some administrative records. you may search the file titles in this series by clicking on “search within this series.” the series covers through 1967, so be sure to verify that the dates covered within any particular file unit(s) you locate match the dates you are interested in. the dates covered by an individual file are listed within the file unit’s description under “details” -- it will note, “this file unit documents the time period,” followed by a date range.,  , there also two series of records specifically related to engineer units stationed in the european theater of operations (eto) in the records of the headquarters, european theater of operations, united states army (world war ii) (record group 498):, engineer unit histories, 1942-1946, organizational unit records, 1943-1947,  , finally, for medical units, there are additional unit records in the records of the office of the surgeon general (army) (record group 112) series, records of historical unit medical detachments (humeds). this series contains copies of reports of army medical units and facilities, as well as reports from medical components of regular army units. reports typically contain narratives about unit activities, descriptions of facilities and locations, and a narrative about organization and administration. reports may also contain statistics, photographs, or maps. the reports do not contain patient medical records. the files are arranged by type of unit and thereunder numerically by unit designation. a paper file list is available for use at the national archives at college park, md.,  , air force:, mission reports:, army air forces world war ii combat operations reports, 1941-1946, also known as “mission reports,” are located at the national archives at college park, md in the records of the army air forces (record group 18). this series consists of the original mission reports pertaining to specific targets. these reports were filed by the units and sometimes include encounter reports by pilots, aerial photographs, and loading lists. you may search the file titles in this series by clicking on “search within this series.”,  , microfilmed unit histories:, there are additional unit histories and supporting documents of army air force and air force units that are still in the custody of the air force at the air force historical research agency (afhra), maxwell air force base, alabama. the national archives has custody of accessioned microfilm copies of some of afhra’s records in the records of u.s. air force commands, activities, and organizations (record group 342), entry (ud) 1006-b1. these microfilmed records are available to view at the national archives at college park, md. although we do not have an official index to the records, there is a private website, air force history index, which can serve as a finding aid to the records. if the irisref number in the “document detail” page begins with an a, b, or c, the national archives may have the document on our accessioned microfilm. all of the reels are not available, so please be sure to contact the reference staff (email: archives2reference@nara.gov), if you locate a document of interest.,  , army and army air forces morning reports and unit rosters:, unit rosters:, we frequently get requests for unit rosters from world war ii. unfortunately, rosters for units serving in world war ii from 1944-46 were destroyed in accordance with army records disposition authorities after the war. there are copies of most of the monthly rosters from 1912-43 and 1947-59 for army units (including army air corps) in the custody of the national archives in st. louis, mo. for information on how to request rosters, please visit the website access to morning reports and unit rosters.,  , unit morning reports:, morning reports list daily personnel changes. they are “exception based” reports, meaning that a soldier’s name will on appear on the report only if his status has changed from the previous report (e.g. from present for duty to ordinary leave, or from present for duty to sick in quarters, etc.). the entries show the name of service member, service number/ssn, and rank. also shown are unit strength, the location of the unit, and sometimes a record of events. morning reports for army units from november 1, 1912 to 1959 and air force units from september 1947 to june 30, 1966 are in the custody of the national archives at st. louis, mo. for information on how to access morning reports, please visit the website access to morning reports and unit rosters.,  , navy:, there are several records groups containing wwii navy records in the custody of the textual reference archives ii branch at the national archives at college park, md. the two primary record groups are the records of the bureau of naval personnel (record group 24), which includes world war ii-era deck logs and muster rolls and the records of the office of the chief of naval operations, 1875 - 2006 (record group 38), which includes war diaries and action reports.,  , deck logs:, deck logs comprise the series, logbooks of u.s. navy ships and stations, 1941-1983. a number of deck logs have been digitized and

and any unusual events. the logs sometimes include information related to operational activities, although the level of content and detail can vary. more detailed information about deck logs is available on nara’s the text message blog, know your records: u.s. navy deck logs and 1941-1959 deck logs, including world war ii and the korean war.,  , muster rolls and personnel diaries:, wwii navy

lack muster rolls, particularly for smaller units and advance bases. personnel diaries provide compiled monthly and list significant personnel status changes, including transfers, promotions, leave, or temporary duty. more detailed information about muster rolls and personnel diaries is available on nara’s text message blog’s  know your records: u.s. navy muster rolls and personnel diaries. the

wildfires engulfed Gruinard Island, Scottish island where government scientists once conducted biological warfare expe', '[wildfire warnings have been issued across many parts of scotland over the past few weeks. image credit: bumble dee/shutterstock.com, over the past weekend, \"apocalyptic\" wildfires engulfed a scottish island where government scientists once conducted biological warfare experiments with anthrax., gruinard island off the northwest coast of scotland was ablaze from \"one end to the other\" on the night of saturday, march 26, with eyewitnesses describing the scene as \"apocalyptic,\" according to bbc news. by sunday, flames had largely subsided on the 2-kilometer (1.2 miles) long uninhabited island, but much of the land was left charred and gently smoking. , sleepy islands off the coast of scotland aren\'t known for their eventful pasts, but the recent wildfires are just the latest chapter in the surprisingly busy history of this island. , during the second world war, gruinard island was the site of a biological warfare experiment carried out by british military scientists who were toying with the idea of using anthrax against nazi germany. one of these potential plots, sinisterly known as \"operation vegetarian,\" would have involved dropping linseed cakes containing anthrax bacterial spores over the cattle fields of germany with the aim of wiping out their food supply, as well as indiscriminately infecting thousands of civilians with the bacteria. , anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis that can be spread by the bacterium\'s spores. the bacterium normally rests in spore form soil, and can survive for decades in this state, ready to infect an unsuspecting victim. it can result in a potentially fatal infection that can cause an array of symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected. if the skin is infected, it can cause blisters, bumps, and sores, but inhaling the bacteria can lead to fever, coughing, confusion, intense sweating, and extreme tiredness., when inhaled, it\'s lethal. it is fatal in almost all cases, even with treatment., , after hearing rumors that the axis powers were thinking about using anthrax as a biological weapon, a highly secret group of government scientists was put together by the uk ministry of defense to assess the feasibility and hazard of anthrax as a biological warfare agent., by 1942, gruinard island, found in the uk’s most uninhabited corner, was picked out as the perfect site. the victims were an unfortunate flock of 80 sheep that were taken to the island. as you can see in declassified footage of the experiment, the animals were placed in unusual stocks so they were unable to move and positioned with their heads facing the location of the bomb denotation. in the summer of 1942, a 13.6-kilogram (30-pound) bomb containing bacillus anthracis was dropped on the island, followed by a smaller 1.8 kilogram (4-pound) bomb the following year., lo and behold, the sheep all died in the following days after contracting anthrax. a team of scientists, donned in somewhat creepy hazmat protective suits, ventured to the island and analyzed the sheep, dissecting their bodies to understand the effects of the disease. once studied, the bodies were chucked into a make-shift incinerator on the island., the year after ww2 ended, the uk government agreed to acquire the island and promptly put it under quarantine. it wasn’t until 1986 scientists returned to the island, vaccinated against anthrax and dressed in protective clothing, to properly decontaminate the area by spraying the top layer of soil with seawater and formaldehyde. they also tested rabbits on the island for antibodies to anthrax and detected none, suggesting they had not been exposed to the bacteria. , following these efforts, a report in 1988 concluded: \"[w]e believe that the chances of persons or animals contracting anthrax on gruinard island are so remote that the island can be returned to civil use\". two years later, the island was handed back to the heirs of the original owner for a price of £500. it was declared free of anthrax by the ministry of defence in april 1990. nevertheless, the land remains uninhabited by humans to this day. , sign up today to get weekly science coverage direct to your inbox, this website uses cookies, this website

(v.) to attack and eat another species., star: the basic building block from which galaxies are made. stars develop when gravity compacts clouds of gas. when they become hot enough, stars will emit light and sometimes other forms of electromagnetic radiation. the sun is our closest star., tag: (in conservation science) to attach some rugged band or package of instruments onto an animal. sometimes the tag is used to give each individual a unique identification number. once attached to the leg, ear or other part of the body of a critter, it can effectively become the animal’s “name.” in some instances, a tag can collect information from the environment around the animal as well. this helps scientists understand both the environment and the animal’s role within it., taste: one of

brasil, las citas de 2022, donde un solo piloto puede sumar 34 puntos en el fin de semana. se arregla el esperpento de spa: no habrá puntos sin lucha, la fia empieza a abrir el tarro de las decisiones de cara a 2022. por ahora se guarda para más adelante la que más morbo suscita, la de abu dabi y la cabeza de michael masi, pero deja la primera gran decisión de esta temporada, dentro de la comision de la f1 (fia, f1 y equipos): las nuevas carreras al sprint., este año volverán a ser tres citas, emila romagna (ímola) el 24 de abril, austria (red bull ring) el 10 de julio y brasil (interlagos) el 13 de noviembre, sin incrementarse el tope presupuestario, establecido en 140 millones, tal y como habían solicitado los equipos., pero el principal cambio es el propio formato, que, de hecho, ya cambia desde el propio nombre. ya no es clasificación al sprint, sino simplemente sprint. entre otras cosas porque no da la pole estadística, sino que esta se logrará el viernes, al más rápido al estilo tradicional. que es lo que pedían muchos pilotos, con vettel a la cabeza, que la pole fuera la pole de toda la vida, al más veloz a una vuelta con nada de gasolina. el formato de clasificación se pasa así al viernes en estas tres citas, y permanecerá el sábado en las otras 20. pero solo será a nivel estadístico, ya que saldrá primero el domingo el que gane la sprint del sábado., el segundo gran cambio es que puntuarán los ocho primeros de la carrera. el que gane sumará 8, el segundo 7, el tercero 6 y así hasta el octavo que sumará 1. así el sprint vale para salir primero (no para la pole) y vale para sumar puntos de verdad, es como una segunda carrera aunque previsiblemente no tenga el podio y los himnos como la del domingo para no eclipsarla. en estas tres carreras, un piloto podría llegar a sumar 34 puntos entre los 25 de la victoria del domingo, los 8 de la del sábado y el extra de la vuelta rápida., igualmente la comisión ha entrado en el esperpento que se produjo en el pasado gran premio de bélgica con aquél reparto de puntos al disputarse solo dos vueltas tras el coche de seguridad por la lluvia., desde ahora no se otorgarán puntos a menos que el líder haya completado un mínimo de dos vueltas sin la intervención de un safety car y/o del virtual safety car., si el líder ha completado más de dos vueltas pero menos del 25% de la distancia de carrera programada, los cinco primeros clasificados recibirán puntos de la siguiente manera:, 1º - 6 puntos, 2º - 4 puntos, 3º- 3 puntos, 4º - 2 puntos, 5º - 1 punto, si el líder ha completado el 25% pero menos del 50% de la distancia de carrera programada, los puntos se otorgarán de la siguiente manera:, 1º - 13 puntos, 2º - 10 puntos, 3 ° - 8 puntos, 4º - 6 puntos, 5º - 5 puntos, 6º - 4 puntos, 7º - 3 puntos, 8º - 2 puntos, 9º - 1 punto, y por último si el líder ha completado el 50% pero menos del 75% de la distancia de carrera programada, los puntos se otorgarán de la siguiente manera:, 1º - 19 puntos, 2º - 14 puntos, 3 ° - 12 puntos, 4º - 9 puntos, 5º - 8 puntos, 6º - 6 puntos, 7º - 5 puntos, 8º - 3 puntos, 9º - 2 puntos, 10º - 1 punto, _hommerj_, y luego querrán comparar los puntos que se ganan ahora, hasta 34 puntos por carrera, con los 10 que se ganaban anteriormente, schumacher o alonso en 2005, 2006...para ganar 34 puntos tendrían que ganar 3 carreras y media xd!..pero nah..luego para el ranking de los puntos históricos por pilotos lo suman todo en el mismo sitio..., javumun13, @fitsnake #1cerraryo no quiero carreras al sprint. @fitsnake #1cerraryo no quiero carreras al

Today, we’re excited to recap the latest news about Google Maps Platform, fresh from the developer keynote.', '[, google maps platform, earlier today, the first ever virtual google i/o developer conference kicked off, welcoming developers from all over the globe to learn, share, and hear announcements from across google. today, we’re excited to recap the latest news about google maps platform, fresh from the developer keynote., webgl-powered maps features beta release, as part of cloud-based maps styling, we introduced the vector map, which will be generally available on javascript over the next few weeks, and delivers the same performant, webgl-accelerated map you know from the google maps web experience to your web apps for the first time. webgl is a low-level browser api that makes it possible to render amazingly complex 2d and 3d graphics on the web by giving the browser access to the processing and rendering power of the gpu on client devices., today, we are releasing two new webgl-powered features for the maps javascript api in beta: tilt and rotation, and webgl overlay view. to see them in action, check out our webgl feature tour, and webgl travel demos built by our friends at ubilabs., tilt and rotation, until now, your maps have been limited to a two-dimensional, top-down view of the basemap. with programmatic tilt and rotation, you can give your users an entirely new perspective with 67.5 degrees of tilt and full 360 rotation of the map both on load and at runtime. this also means our oblique 3d building models will appear in your web apps for the first time., we’ve also added keyboard and mouse controls to allow users to manually change the tilt and rotation of the map, opening up a whole new level of user interaction for your web apps. , webgl overlay view, if you‘re excited about being able to control the basemap in three dimensions with tilt and rotation, then you’re going to love webgl overlay view, which provides a fundamentally new way to build mapping experiences by giving you direct hooks into the lifecycle of the webgl rendering context we use to render the vector map., with webgl overlay view, for the first time ever you can render two and three dimensional objects directly on the basemap. this means not only will your rendered objects appear on the map, they will be rendered as part of the map in three-dimensional space with occlusion and perspective. for example, take a look at this webgl overlay view implementation of 3d markers. notice how the markers become hidden from view behind buildings as the map rotates, and get smaller as they move away from the camera., to get started, check out our webgl codelab and our documentation. if you were not able to attend the session at google i/o, you can also learn more from travis mcphail’s session, ‘next generation maps for the web\', at 3:30pm tomorrow, 5/19, and will also be available on-demand on our youtube channel., cloud-based maps styling for javascript general availability, in june 2020, we released the beta of cloud-based maps styling features, a new set of capabilities to help you customize, manage, and deploy your maps from the google cloud console. this included the introduction of a rich, intuitive, ui-based style editor that lets you deeply customize the look and behavior of the map from zoom-level customization to custom styling commercial corridors. additionally, we introduced industry optimized map styles that kickstart map creation to get you started fast., today, we are announcing that cloud-based maps styling is officially generally available for the maps javascript api and the maps static api. we’ve spent the last 11 months improving the in-console experience and overall performance to enable your entire team to build better maps. , to everyone who tried cloud-based maps styling in beta, thank you. your feedback has been invaluable in getting to general availability, and our team has been excited to see so many new custom maps now driving tens of millions of map loads every day, including in other google products., , , what’s next?, we’re continuing to improve rendering and performance of these new features, and we’re constantly working to build a map that delivers an experience as rich as the world you live in. to do that, we need your help. don’t forget to submit bug reports, feature requests, and feedback via our issue tracker to help us improve these new map features., nearly 16 years ago, we delivered the first google maps api, and since then we’ve been inspired by all the ways you’ve reimagined the map. tilt and rotation, webgl overlay view, and cloud-based maps styling are just the latest ways we’re working to enable you to create a new generation of mapping experiences. we can’t wait to see the amazing things you’ll build., , , related article, this year marked the first ever virtual google i/o, and even though we couldn’t be together in person, we appreciated getting the chance to still connect with our developer community around the world. whether you spent hours in our virtual dome in google i/o adventure, or could only make it to a few sessions, not to worry. we’re here with a quick recap of everything google maps platform from google i/o 2021., follow us]', 'google maps platform announcements from
