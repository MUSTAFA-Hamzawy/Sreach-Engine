audiences, artists and artâ€”these are our watchwords as we continue to navigate the challenges of our times. many of our 21/22 offerings have been and will continue to be presented virtually, through our experience-rich event portals that gather together concerts, conversations, lectures, electronic resources and programs in one easy-to-access location. while challenges with the pandemic continue to  impact our ability to offer live programs, we intend to resume in-person events  later this spring, beginning with our first in-person live event in april.  until that time we hope that you continue to enjoy our presentations being  offered virtually. because of shifting needs of our artists and audience, we  will be announcing our spring events month by month, with our next announcement  about april events coming in march
