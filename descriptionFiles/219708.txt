this study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the gdpr, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party cmp services as an effective way to increase compliance. new consent management platforms (cmps) have been introduced to the web to conform with the eu s general data protection regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users  personal data. this work analyses how the most prevalent cmp designs affect people s consent choices. we scraped the designs of the five most popular cmps on the top 10,000 websites in the uk (n=680). we found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on european law. second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. we found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. this study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the gdpr, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party cmp services as an effective way to increase compliance.
