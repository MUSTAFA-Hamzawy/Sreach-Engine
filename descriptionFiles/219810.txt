it is concluded that cmps process personal data, and two major cmp providers in the eu: quantcast and onetrust are paired with a legal analysis, and multiple scenarios wherein c mps are controllers are identified. consent management providers (cmps) provide consent popups that are embedded in ever more websites over time to enable streamlined compliance with the legal requirements for consent mandated by the eprivacy directive and the general data protection regulation (gdpr). they implement the standard for consent collection from the transparency and consent framework (tcf) (current version v2.0) proposed by the european branch of the interactive advertising bureau (iab europe). although the iabâ€™s tcf specifications characterize cmps as data processors, cmps factual activities often qualifies them as data controllers instead. discerning their clear role is crucial since compliance obligations and cmps liability depend on their accurate characterization. we perform empirical experiments with two major cmp providers in the eu: quantcast and onetrust and paired with a legal analysis. we conclude that cmps process personal data, and we identify multiple scenarios wherein cmps are controllers.
