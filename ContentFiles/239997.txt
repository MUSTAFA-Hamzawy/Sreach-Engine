[albert wan ran bleak house books.&& an independent bookstore in hong kong.&& for nearly five years.&& before closing it in late 2021. the changing political climate and crackdown on dissent within hong kong made life too uncertain for wan.&& his wife and two children. .&& as they were preparing to move.&& wan packed a box of books at risk of being purged by the government. he brought them on a plane back to the united states in january and donated them to the internet archive for preservation. .&& the collection includes books about the pro-democracy protests of 2019—some photography books; another was a limited edition book of essays by young journalists who covered the event. there was a book about the tiananmen square massacre and volumes about hong kong politics.&& culture and history—most written in chinese. .&& “in hong kong.&& because the government is restricting and policing speech in a way that is even causing libraries to remove books from shelves.&& i thought that it would be good to digitize books about hong kong that might be in danger of disappearing entirely.&&” wan said..&& “i thought that it would be good to digitize books about hong kong that might be in danger of disappearing entirely.”.&& hearing that bleak house books would be shutting its doors.&& the internet archive reached out and offered to digitize its remaining books. as it happens.&& wan said his inventory was dwindling quickly. so.&& he gathered contributions from others.&& and along with some from his own collection.&& donated about thirty books and some periodicals to the internet archive for preservation and digitization. wan said he was amazed at how flexible and open the archive was in the process.&& assisting with shipping and scanning the materials at no cost to him. (see hong kong community collection.).&& now.&& wan wants others to do the same..&& “there are still titles out there that have never been digitized and might be on the radar for being purged or sort

them.”.&& do you have books you’d like to donate to the internet archive? learn more..&& wan said he likes how the internet archive operates using controlled digital lending (cdl) where the items can

library week 2022.&& we are taking readers behind the scenes to meet the librarians who work at the internet archive and in associated programs..&& alexis rossi has always loved books and connecting others with information. after receiving her undergraduate degree in english and creative writing.&& she became a book editor and then worked in online news. .&& in 2006.&& rossi joined the staff of the internet archive. she was working on the launch of the open library project when she recognized the need to learn more about how to best organize materials. she enrolled at san jose state university and earned her master’s of library and information science in 2010..&& “it gave me a better grasp of how to hierarchically organize information in a way that is sensible and useful to other libraries.&&” rossi said. “it also gave me better familiarity with how other more traditional libraries actually work—the types of data and systems they use.”.&& rossi concentrated on web interfaces for library information.&& understanding digital metadata.&& and how to operate as a digital librarian. in addition to overseeing the open library project.&& at the internet archive.&& rossi managed a revamp of the organization’s website.&& ran the wayback machine for four years.&& founded the webwide crawling program.&& and is currently a librarian and director of media & access..&& “one of the themes of my life is trying to empower people to do whatever they want to do.&&” said rossi.&& who grew up in monterey.&& california.&& and now lives in san francisco. “giving people the resources to teach themselves—whatever they want to learn—is my driving force.”.&& “giving people the resources to teach themselves—whatever they want to learn—is my driving force.”.&& rossi acknowledges she is privileged to have means to avail herself to an abundance of information.&& while many in other parts of the world do not. there are so many societal problems she cannot solve.&& rossi said.&& but she believes her work is making a contribution.  .&& “we can build a library that allows people to access information for free.&& wherever they are.&& and however they can get to it.&& in whatever way. that.&& to me.&& is incredibly important.&&” rossi said. it’s also rewarding to help patrons discover new information and recover materials they may have thought were lost.&& she added..&& when she’s not working.&& rossi enjoys making funky jewelry and elaborate cakes (a skill she learned on youtube)..&& among the millions of items and collections in the internet archive.&& what is rossi’s favorite? video and audio recordings of her dad.&& now 73.&& playing the piano.&& organ and accordion: “it’s just so good. it’s such a perfect little piece of history.”.&& laura gibbs and helen nde share a passion for african folktales. they are both active researchers and bloggers on the subject who rely on the internet archive’s extensive collection in their work..&& in the third of a series of webinars highlighting how researchers in the humanities use the internet archive.&& gibbs and nde spoke on march 30 about how they use the online library and contribute to its resources..&& watch now:.&& gibbs was teaching at the university of oklahoma in the spring of 2020 when the campus library shut down due to the pandemic. “that’s when i learned about controlled digital lending at the internet archive and that changed everything for me. i hadn’t realized how extensive the materials were.&&” said gibbs.&& who was trained as a folklorist. she retired last may and began a project of cross-referencing her bookshelves of african and african-american folktales to see how many were available at the internet archive. being able to check out one digital title at a time through controlled digital lending (cdl) opened up new possibilities for her research. .&& “it was just mind boggling to me and so exciting.&&” she said of discovering the online library. “i want to be a provocation to get other people to go read.&& do their own writing and thinking from books that we can all access. that’s what the internet archive has miraculously done.”.&& gibbs said it has been very helpful to use the search function using the title of a book.&& name of an illustrator or some other kind of detail. with an account.&& the user can see the search results and borrow the digital book through cdl. “it’s all super easy to do. and if you’re like me and weren’t aware of the amazing resources available through controlled digital lending.&& now is the time to create your account at the internet archive.&&” gibbs said. .&& every day.&& gibbs blogs about a different book and rewrites a 100-word “tiny-tale” synopsis. in less than a year.&& she compiled a reader’s guide to african folktales at the internet archive.&& a curated bibliography of hundreds of folktale books that she has shared with the public through the internet archive. some are in the public domain.&& but many are later works and only available for lending one copy at a time through cdl. .&& in her work.&& nde explores mythological folklore from the african continent and is dedicated to preserving the storyteller traditions of african peoples.&& which is largely oral culture. nde maintains the mythological africans website where she hosts storytelling sessions.&& modern lectures.&& and posts essays..&& “[the internet archive] is an amazing resource of information online.&& which is readily available.&& and really goes to dispel the notion that there is no uniformity of folklore from the african continent.&&” nde said. “through mythological africans.&& i am able to share these stories and make these cultures come alive as much as possible.”.&& as an immigrant in the united states from cameroon.&& nde began to research the topic of african folklore because she was curious about exploring her background and identity. she said she found a community and a creative outlet for examining storytelling.&& poetry.&& dance and folktales. nde said examining gibb’s works gave her an opportunity to reconnect with some of the favorite books from her childhood. she’s also discovered reference books through the internet archive collection that have been helpful. nde is active on social media (twitter.com/mythicafricans) and has a youtube channel on african mythology. she recently collaborated on a project with pbs highlighting the folklore behind an evil entity called the adze.&& which can take the form of a firefly. .&& the presenters said when citing material from the internet archive.&& not only can they link to a source.&& a blog or an academic article.&& they can link to the specific page number in that source. this gives credit to the author and also access to that story for anybody who wants to read it for themselves..&& the next webinar in the series.&& television as data: opening tv news for deep analysis and new forms of interactive search.&& on april 13 will feature roger macdonald.&& founder of the tv news archive and kalev leetaru.&& data scientist at gdelt. register now..&& to celebrate national library week 2022.&& we are taking readers behind the scenes to meet the librarians who work at the internet archive and in associated programs..&& like any good librarian.&& lisa seaberg of the internet archive’s patron services team is prepared to answer the question: can you recommend a book? in fact.&& seaberg has 1.&&729 suggestions. she has organized what she wants to read in a publicly available list on open library..&& “i’ve had a lifelong interest in reading and books.&&” said seaberg.&& who worked as an assistant in her high school library in milford.&& connecticut. it was there that a mentoring librarian helped shape her taste in reading and introduced her to the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy by douglas adams. .&& seaberg went on to earn her bachelor’s degree in library science from southern connecticut state university in 1996. she learned about the book publishing industry.&& practical skills of cataloguing.&& boolean searching.&& and managing databases. she later earned a master’s degree in digital media from quinnipiac university in connecticut..&& in 2017.&& seaberg began to volunteer with open library and was hired to join the internet archive staff in 2020 to work for patron services. based in amsterdam.&& she responds to email requests to connect users with resources and helps coordinate a team of more than 200 volunteers to fix metadata issues. seaberg works to maintain the digital collection.&& identify duplicates.&& and make sure the record represents the available books. she also fulfills interlibrary loan requests.&& as part of the internet archive’s new ill service..&& “it’s rewarding to make something discoverable.”.&& prior joining the internet archive.&& seaberg worked at gateway computers in the late 90s where she gained useful technology experience. she later worked in communications for a hospital.&& managing its website. those positions provided her with a sense of information architecture.&& she said.&& that she has applied to her work at the internet archive..&& seaberg said she is fascinated by everything that the internet archive provides to the public. in her job.&& she enjoys working with the book metadata. “it’s rewarding to make something discoverable.&&” she said. if people have an author they like.&& seaberg tries to make sure there are subject headings and tags to make it easier for them to find related materials of interest. .&& recently.&& seaberg said.&& it’s been meaningful to be involved in efforts to provide access to books being challenged by local school districts because of controversial content. she’s helped assemble digital collections of titles being targeted to ensure continuous access should an entity decide to ban them. .&& when seaberg is not working.&& she loves to play board games—gravitating to hobbyist.&& european games such as the gaia project.&& the complex.&& economy-building game that takes place in space. her other main hobby is book hunting at charity shops and openbare boekenkastjes (free libraries) in and around her home in amsterdam. since seaberg has limited shelf space.&& she sticks to her rule of only buying books that are on her open library want to read list.  .&& among her favorite projects when it comes to the internet archive collection: organizing the profiles of individual authors to make sure their works are all consolidated and easy to find for patrons. .&&
