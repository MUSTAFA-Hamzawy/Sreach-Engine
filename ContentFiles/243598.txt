elements of ragtime with an active left hand that provided a bass characterized by wide leaps.&& or “strides.” “harlem strut.&&” a multi-strain work and a johnson original.&& was his first recorded

johnson is best remembered as the composer of “the charleston” and as the mentor of pianist and composer thomas “fats” waller..&& franklin d. roosevelt: complete presidential speeches (1933-1945).&& the most famous speeches by franklin d. roosevelt are tied to singular events — such as the attack on pearl harbor — but many of his most influential addresses were actually made on otherwise mundane occasions in the 1930s such as his tour of a flood control project in 1936.&& when he delivered the blistering “i hate war” speech.&& anticipating world war ii. others reverberate in our time for different reasons.&& such as when he spoke on behalf of the campaign against polio.&& now nearly eradicated but a dreaded scourge in that era of which he was the disease’s most famous victim. his speeches are far more than sources for historical soundbites.&& they are defining political and social texts of their day that form a narrative of the 12 years of his presidency and of an historical epoch..&& “walking the floor over you” — ernest tubb (1941) (single).&& if “walking the floor over you” wasn’t the first honky-tonk hit in country music.&& it’s certainly on the short list. recorded by “texas troubadour” ernest tubb.&& on april 26.&& 1941 at bunny biggs’ studio in dallas.&& it was notable for the prominence of an electric guitar.&& played by fay “smitty” smith. although bob wills had used an electric guitar as early as 1935.&& wills did so in the context of his large.&& western swing group.&& the texas playboys. reportedly.&& tubb wanted to include an electric guitar so his records would sound louder on jukeboxes and be heard above the din of roadhouses and honky tonks.&& the noisy.&& sometimes rowdy clubs that gave the genre its name. so.&& the use of electric or steel guitar in songs like “walking the floor.&&” signified not the first appearance of those instruments in country music.&& but rather the emergence of a new style. “walking the floor over you” was not only a hit.&& it was influential far beyond the confines of country music.&& begetting covers by artists as diverse as bing crosby.&& georgia gibbs.&& pat boone and brook benton. tubb himself recorded the song several times.&& but it’s this 1941 performance.&& originally released as decca 5958.&& that is generally regarded at the classic..&& “on a note of triumph” (may 8.&& 1945).&& writer norman corwin’s radio tribute to the bill of rights.&& “we hold these truths.&&” was heard by the largest radio audience to date in december of 1941.&& a people searching for affirmation in the wake of their country’s entry into world war ii. three and a half years later.&& “on a note of triumph.&&” his salute to the allied victory in europe.&& aired the evening of v-e day.&& may 8.&& 1945. an enormous audience tuned in again.&& and an encore performance aired five days later and was issued as a record album. the script of the program was rushed into bookstores within a week of the first performance. the 60-minute production was anchored by the passionate narration of martin gabel.&& who led a sonic tour of the years leading up to the war.&& its battlefields.&& and the homes of ordinary people. the title aptly describes the program’s thunderous opening and proclamation of victory. the tone changes.&& however.&& and voices are heard asking questions like “what do we know now that we didn’t know before?” and “what do we do now?” although not a subtle work.&& like its predecessor.&& “on a note of triumph” filled a deep need for its audience..&& “jesus gave me water” — the soul stirrers (1950) (single) “jesus gave me water” comes from the first studio session of a young chicago gospel singer named sam cook.&& seven years before he added an “e” to his last name and gained worldwide fame in pop and r&b. cook was 19.&& with only about 18 months of professional experience on the local gospelscene.&& and had been chosen to replace the much loved and respected leader of the group.&& r.h. harris. without harris.&& the group’s future was uncertain.&& but the combination of its three veteran members with cook and another recent addition.&& tenor paul foster.&& was a winner. cook’s deceptively gentle.&& mellifluous voice was a new sound in the music.&& and drew younger audiences back to gospel programs in droves. cook excelled at songs that told a story.&& and “jesus gave me water” recounts a key event in the life of jesus.&& his encounter with the samaritan woman at the well and the lesson of living water he reveals to her. “jesus gave me water” sold strongly for the specialty label in the spring of 1950.&& reestablishing the soul stirrers as a premier group and launching one of american music’s greatest artists..&& “ellington at newport” — duke ellington (1956) (album).&& after enduring a decade of waning record sales.&& duke ellington reignited his career via one single solo recorded in 1956. after their short set at the newport jazz festival.&& on july 7.&& 1956.&& duke and his orchestra were recalled to the stage. one of the numbers they performed at that time was the 1930s composition “diminuendo and crescendo in blue.” for this piece.&& at first.&& just the rhythm section played.&& then they were joined by the full orchestra. then.&& saxophonist paul gonsalves jumped in.&& and at the urging of the crowd and ellington himself.&& wailed through 27 choruses. the performance was historic. “time” magazine would later call it a turning point in ellington’s career and the duke himself later said.&& “i was born in 1956 at the newport festival.” for decades.&& this performance was only available to record buyers in a version sourced from a tape where gonsalves was off-mic and could only be heard beneath the band and audience. but.&& years later.&& a location tape recorded for overseas broadcast by voice of america was discovered.&& and a restored version was finally released as part of a 1999 cd set..&& “we insist!  max roach’s freedom now suite” — max roach (1960) (album).&& throughout his career.&& drummer max roach constantly sought to extend the boundaries of jazz.&& both stylistically and in the service of political change. “we insist!” consists of an innovative suite featuring singer abby lincoln performing lyrics by oscar brown.&& jr..&& accompanied by roach.&& legendary tenor sax player coleman hawkins (on “driva’ man”).&& booker little (trumpet).&& julian priester (trombone).&& walter benton (tenor sax) and james schenk (bass). shortly after the album’s release.&& roach stated that he would “never again play anything that does not have social significance.&&” and he urged black musicians to “employ our skill to tell the dramatic story of our people.” the album masterfully fulfills this brief. “driva’ man” focuses on the history of slavery and the notorious figure of the slave driver.&& while “freedom” and “tryptich: prayer/protest/peace” deal with emancipation.&& the ambiguous legacy of freedom.&& and protest. side two.&& devoted to pan-african themes.&& features a larger percussion ensemble including babatunde olatunji.&& raymond mantilla and thomas du vall. the resulting works are heavily influenced by african rhythms; they also foreshadow roach’s future work with the percussion ensemble m’boom..&& “the christmas song” — nat king cole (1961) (single).&& one of america’s favorite holiday songs was inspired by a hot summer day. during a sweltering july afternoon in 1945.&& while visiting his frequent songwriting collaborator.&& robert wells.&& at his toluca lake.&& california.&& home.&& mel tormé noticed some lines wells had written to distract himself from the heat.&& with wintry images like “jack frost nipping at your nose.” sensing their potential as a song.&& wells and tormé went to work and in less than an hour created an enduring holiday standard. although tormé himself was an accomplished singer.&& he felt that a bigger name was needed to generate more record sales. he and wells pitched the song to nat king cole.&& the leader of a long established jazz trio.&& who was becoming a popular vocalist. cole recorded “the christmas song” four times: in june 1946 with just his trio; in august of that same year with an added string section; in 1953 with a full orchestra.&& conducted by nelson riddle.&& and in 1961 with a full orchestra.&& conducted by ralph carmichael.&& the first stereo version and the one most commonly heard today. according to reports.&& king cole trio guitarist oscar moore created the “jingle bells” coda heard at the end of every one of cole’s versions. “the christmas song” is said to be one of the most recorded holiday songs in history.&& but it’s cole’s 1961 performance.&& with perhaps his most lush vocal take.&& that is generally regarded as definitive..&& “tonight’s the night” — the shirelles (1961) (album).&& the shirelles are often referred to as a “girl group.&&” but as their first album demonstrates.&& they sang with the grown-up passion of teens entering their 20s.&& a winning combination that made them trendsetters in the early 1960s. shirley owens.&& beverly lee.&& doris kenner and adele “micki” harris met in junior high school in passaic.&& new jersey. the three hit singles from.&& this.&& their first album — “will you love me tomorrow.&&” “dedicated to the one i love.&&” and the title track — remain moving performances that still communicate maturing desire with plaintive vulnerability.&& while other album tracks like “boys.&&” later covered by the beatles.&& are delivered with untroubled gusto and abandon. “tonight’s the night.&&” may have once seemed like kid’s stuff.&& but it has stood the test of time..&& “moon river” — andy williams (1962) (single).&& though first introduced to audiences in the 1961 audrey hepburn film “breakfast at tiffany’s” (in which hepburn herself sang it).&& “moon river” is forever associated with smooth pop singer andy williams. it became his signature hit.&& and he sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of each and every episode of his long-running television variety show. simple yet endearing.&& the song’s evocative lyrics.&& as the “financial times” once noted.&& “are a metaphor of yearning for the unpredictable eddies of an adventurous life.&& to be swept along by the currents of somewhere new.” the success of the song made it a modern standard and relaunched the career of its lyricist johnny mercer. though “moon river” has gone on to be recorded more than 500 times by everyone from frank sinatra to louis armstrong to judy garland (and there’s even a joan rivers funny version and hepburn’s version certainly has its charms).&& it is williams’ flawless rendition that endures..&& “in c” — terry riley (1968) (album).&& terry riley’s composition.&& “in c.&&” forgoes a traditional score and.&& instead.&& is comprised of 53 melodic phrases that may be played and repeated at the discretion of each musician and accommodates any number of instruments. it was first performed in 1964 at san francisco’s tape music center.&& where riley worked with other groundbreaking experimental composers such as steve reich.&& morton subotnick and pauline oliveros. the composition filled both sides of the album.&& which riley recorded for columbia record’s music of our time series of albums in 1968.&& with riley playing saxophone and leading a group of 10 musicians. this series aimed to introduce to the home listening public new and experimental music forms.&& and riley’s work proved to be a popular and influential release across several genres.&& including classical rock and jazz. the album’s recording featured a group of performers for whom months of preparation lent confidence to the ever shifting improvisatory nature of the composition..&& “it’s a small world” — the disneyland boys choir (1964) (single).&& richard m. and robert b. sherman’s song “it’s a small world” was first heard at a pavilion at the 1964-1965 world’s fair in new york. there.&& guides costumed as disney characters helped visitors into small boats that took them through tunnels adorned with brightly-colored puppets representing children from around the world.&& who cheerfully sang it to them. today.&& the same experience can be had at disneyland in california.&& where the ride was moved and reconstructed after the fair closed at the end of its second season in october 1965. since then.&& the song has been heard daily ever since.&& as well as at other disney theme parks.&& making it one of the most widely heard and remembered songs of all time. the motto of the 1964-65 world’s fair was “peace.&& through understanding.&&” but.&& day by day in the middle of the 1960s.&& there seemed to be less and less of that in the world. still.&& the ride and the song became two of the most hopeful things about the fair.&& and it has endured. during the fair’s first season.&& the song was only available on a 7-inch disc at the fair itself but was later distributed to stores between the fair’s two seasons and eventually became part of an album of the same name..&& “reach out.&& i’ll be there” — the four tops (1966) (single).&& according to the motown museum.&& “reach out.&& ill be there” was the four tops’ biggest hit and is considered the vocal group’s theme song. recorded in studio a at hitsville usa and both written and produced by the powerhouse team of holland-dozier-holland.&& the lyrics grew out of their feeling that women “wanted someone to be there for them.&& through thick or thin.” lamont dozier said that he wanted to write “a journey of emotions with sustained tension.&& like a bolero.” to achieve that.&& he “alternated the keys.&& from a minor.&& russian feel in the verse to a major.&& gospel feel in the chorus.” levi stubbs’ impassioned vocal was inspired by an unlikely source: bob dylan. according to dozier.&& they were inspired by dylan’s shout singing style on “like a rolling stone” and wanted lead vocalist stubbs to sing like that. to give his vocal added intensity.&& holland-dozier-holland put stubbs at the top of his vocal range so he would have to strain a little. the “galloping” sound.&& heard prominently at the beginning of the song.&& is a series of triplet beats struck on the plastic head of a tambourine with no jingles.&& played by motown producer norman whitfield. levi stubbs improvised the lyric.&& “just look over your shoulder.” it sounded good.&& so they kept it in..&& hank aaron’s 715th career home run (april 8.&&

of “the record that would never be broken” is one of baseball’s — and radio’s — greatest ever calls..&& “bohemian rhapsody” — queen (1975) (single).&& “bohemian rhapsody” breaks nearly every rule in the playbook for rock songs: it starts with a gentle a cappella intro; it has a complex structure without a chorus; and it clocks in at nearly six minutes. nonetheless.&& songwriter and vocalist
