[investing may 16.&& 2022.&& by: david hanson.&& i am incredibly lucky..&& as a long-time tech stock analyst at the motley fool.&& every day i wake up and get the chance to help everyday people identify and profit from some of the world’s most promising investment opportunities..&& and it’s times of uncertainty and confusion that really open the doors to some of the best opportunities available to investors like you and me..&& with so much sudden turmoil in the stock market.&& you may not even realize that youre about to miss an important and rare event in stock market history….&& you see.&& ive stumbled onto a practically unknown (yet publicly traded) company following so closely in amazons footsteps that it has seriously caught the attention of our team of investors -- a legendary group who actually did recommend amazon back in 1997 and racked up over 40.&&000% gains in the process….&& and simply put.&& our track-record of identifying the right companies at the forefront of technology in the stuff of legend..&& in addition to recommending investors get in early on amazon.&& analysts at the motley fool have correctly predicted the success of many of the market’s biggest winners – stocks like:.&& now.&& of course not every single one of our stocks has been as successful as these incredible winners…but there’s no need for me to cherry-pick returns….&& because here’s the bottom line:.&& weve been recommending stocks a few decades now.&& and our average stock pick has returned a mind-boggling 345%... that’s nearly 4x the return of the s&p 500..&& which brings me back to the under-the-radar (yet fast-growing) stock weve recommended.&& which has some striking similarities to amazon back in 1997….&& i realize thats a bold statement.&& so allow me to explain....&& first off.&& we knew that ecommerce was a market just waiting for a top dog. we said as much back in 1997.&& when we first recommended investors buy shares of the ecommerce giant..&& amazon was a small-cap stock that had just gone public on may 15.&& 1997. just four months later.&& we published a detailed.&& 4.&&250 word “buy” report on amazon’s stock. in this revolutionary buy alert.&& we predicted jeff bezos’ vision for amazon.&& presciently telling investors “amazon is about more than just books..&& fast-forward to today.&& and amazon’s stock is up over a mind-boggling 40.&&000% -- turning every $5.&&000 invested in amazon into more than $2.&&000.&&000 today..&& and in those 24 years.&& ecommerce has grown into a behemoth that has fundamentally changed the retail world as we know it. look no further than april 2020.&& when i first noticed this chart..&& first.&& you can see that ecommerce grew 10 percentage points from 2009 to 2019. but then.&& it grew another 10 percentage points…in just 8 weeks!.&& that’s essentially one decade of growth in just two months!.&& and while amazon is the dominant player in this move to online shopping…they only make up a fraction of those sales!.&& we’ve been studying this trend for years here at the motley fool.&& pouring in capital and resources to find a stock worthy of being ‘the next amazon.’.&& and we think we’ve found just that..&& now.&& while you can’t go back in time to 1997 and invest in amazon alongside us.&& i believe i’m offering you the next best thing….&& the chance to get in on this stock i think resembles amazon in its early years..&& first.&& the stock has already crushed the market since it went public in may 2015..&& second.&& the company has nearly doubled its paying members over the past four years..&& even more exciting.&& management expects double-digit revenue growth going forward..&& that’s the type of growth and market opportunity that gets our entire investment teams hearts pumping..&& remember the old saying.&& “the early bird gets the worm” – an ageless mantra reminding us early movers often have the best chance of success..&& that’s exactly why were recommending investors like you buy shares -- despite the recent volatility in the market due everything thrown at us in 2020 and beyond..&& and while we would never guarantee this recommendation will produce amazon-like returns.&& this stock is already up 715% since it was first recommended..&& even though timing isn’t everything.&& history shows that it can pay to move early on stocks like this one -- especially when you remember the average pick in stock advisor is up 345%! (and yes.&& that includes all our winners and losers!).&& there’s just one catch:.&& were only sharing the details of the stock with members of the motley fools flagship investing service.&& motley fool stock advisor..&& now.&& if youre not familiar with my motley fool stock advisor service.&& this is the award-winning online investing service created to provide easy-to-follow.&& monthly stock recommendations to individual investors..&& thats right! each and every month.&& over 1 million investors tune in to discover which stocks we believe investors should be buying shares of today..&& which brings me back to the under-the-radar company we think is a rock-solid “buy” in today’s bumpy market….&& because we want as many investors as possible to potentially profit from this fast-growing company.&& we published a comprehensive “buy” report inside stock advisor that shows you exactly why we believe it has so much upside..&& it reveals the reasons why we think every forward-thinking investor should be paying close attention to this alert and what might be a potentially life-changing investment opportunity..&& this report is free to you when you sign up for stock advisor today..&& simply click below to sign up and learn about this investment opportunity..&& simply click below to sign up and learn more about this investment opportunity....&& by submitting your email address.&& you consent to us keeping you informed about updates to our website and about other products and services that we think might interest you. you can unsubscribe at any time. please read our privacy statement and terms & conditions..&& motley fool stock advisor returns are 384% as compared to the s&p 500 returns of 129% as of may 4.&& 2022. past performance is not a guarantee of future results. individual investment results may vary. all investing involves risk of loss..&& all other returns are updated during market hours. john mackey.&& ceo of whole foods market.&& an amazon subsidiary.&& is a member of the motley fool’s board of directors. david hanson owns shares of activision blizzard.&& amazon.&& match group.&& nvidia.&& and walt disney. the motley fool owns shares of activision blizzard.&& amazon.&& booking holdings.&& match group.&& netflix.&& nvidia.&& and walt disney. the motley fool has a disclosure policy..&& the motley fool respects your privacy and strive to be transparent about our data collection practices. we use your information to customize the site for you.&& to contact you about your membership.&& provide you with promotional information.&& and in aggregate to help us better understand how the service is used..&& past performance is not a predictor of future results. individual investment results may vary. all investing involves risk of loss..&& privacy/legal information..&& ©1995-2022 the motley fool. all rights reserved. | legal information | privacy information][this stock could be like buying amazon in 1997, netflix, up 10,019%, nvidia, up 4,484%, activision blizzard, up 4,809%, priceline.com, up 8,765%, marvel, up 5,840%, do you know which stock were talking about?, dont wait to find out., then act fast!]this stock could be like buying amazon in 1997[really, netflix, up 10,019%, nvidia, up 4,484%, activision blizzard, up 4,809%, priceline.com, up 8,765%, marvel, up 5,840%, weve been recommending stocks a few decades now, and our average stock pick has returned a mind-boggling , 345, %... that’s nearly 4x the return of the s&p 500., “the early bird gets the worm” , this stock is already up, 715% , there’s just one catch:][]
