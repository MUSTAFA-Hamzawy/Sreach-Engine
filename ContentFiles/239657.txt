my website has a lot of exclusive content i’ve either written myself or outsourced but it appears a lot of it is popping it up all over the web without my permission. do you know any techniques to help reduce content from being ripped off? i’d really appreciate it., fredrik june 7, 2013 at 11:38 am i love the internet archive! it is a wonderful resource, and in particular i have made much use of the moving images collections. however, at times i find it a bit chaotic. it is hard to find the really good stuff among all the noise. to somewhat improve upon this situation i have started a blog about movies i found at the archive and enjoyed. you can find the blog here: silver in a haystack. i hope i can pay back for some of all the enjoyment that the internet archive has given me., louie ludwig november 27, 2013 at 9:33 pm hello, fine archivists. i’ve found a mislabeled/cataloged file in your moving pictures archives. the file titled “shape of the future,” which is described as a series of outtakes from advertising footage (https://archive.org/details/0612_shape_of_the_future_the_18_10_57_00) actually appears to be, at the front end, stock from a sunoco commercial and, at the back, footage taken of people working on eugene mccarthy’s 1968 presidential campaign. i point this out not (only) because i’m a stickler, but because there may be some historical value in the mccarthy campaign footage and you might want to find the original. thanks for your fine work. louie ludwig, robert roy january 29, 2014 at 4:33 pm i was wondering if you could help me find the names, or the actual short films that aired after the first showing of the movie “the great escape”. it was aired in two parts on separate nights in 1967 on cbs. one of them was named “rain” (i think) and the other was a stop motion/animated monty python’ish type film. i have been searching for these short films for some time and would like to see them again, thanks in advance for any help on this, pingback: call for data backup during times of crisis | j.e. molly seegers, adele casamassima august 1, 2014 at 6:42 am hello everyone, this is a fantastic tool for my work! i wanted to ask for your advise as i am looking for webpages from european websites but all i can get from my searches in archive.org are images from the us websites. any advise about how to use archu=ive.org to extract snapshots from european websites? do you know about any other web resource enabling me to do that? thank you in advance for helping out adele, im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore may 6, 2015 at 8:20 pm what a pain in the ass your new website design is. i am so goddam tired of peurile programmers designing websites when they have no clue as to how users work and what they need. i used to be able to search for texts; apparently i can no longer do that. i have to first search for all sorts of crap, then filter down to what i really need. although the advanced search allows one to specify a search in texts, it’s slower than molasses. what a waste of time. as this site has no respect for its users and their time, i have no respect for this site. buh-bye. andrew bontrager may 9, 2015 at 3:03 pm you can still use the classic site (hopefully forever, but who knows). under the mediatypes, you should see a link called services/exit_beta or something similar. i totally agree with you about the new interface. it seems much more cluttered to me than the classic site. all the new images and item choices on a details page eat up precious bandwidth, so i’ll be using the classic version as long as possible., andrew bontrager may 9, 2015 at 3:03 pm you can still use the classic site (hopefully forever, but who knows). under the mediatypes, you should see a link called services/exit_beta or something similar. i totally agree with you about the new interface. it seems much more cluttered to me than the classic site. all the new images and item choices on a details page eat up precious bandwidth, so i’ll be using the classic version as long as possible., margot robinson may 22, 2015 at 5:53 am you should be ashamed of yourselves. cutting shows down into one minute segments renders them useless for viewing online and you ought to know it. there is no way you can say that this is truly a service to anyone. charging people $25 to view an entire episode is doubly shameful. not everyone has the money to pay this, and not everyone has the time. i think cutting the shows into such small and useless segments is an underhanded way to extract money from people who simply want something useful. and if they can’t afford it, they can ” just eat cake.” put the full episodes up in the tv news archive, and do a real public service instead of making it truly useful only to people with money., kathy graves may 29, 2015 at 10:21 pm i am the current president of the siskiyou county historical society. i noticed you have a free download of a book entitled, “history of siskiyou county” by wells. the hsitorical society is under the impression (although a little more research needs to be done) that we hold the current copyright on that book. if that proves to be the case we would request that you remove the title from your free downloads. if you have any documents that show permission was given to allow you to include that book in your array of titles, we would like to see it. thank you. internetarchive post authormay 30, 2015 at 2:40 am please send your request to info@archive.org. if you are referring to https://archive.org/details/historyofsiskiyo00well that appears to have been published in 1881 which typically places it in the public domain. nonetheless, please send your request. thank you., internetarchive post authormay 30, 2015 at 2:40 am please send your request to info@archive.org. if you are referring to https://archive.org/details/historyofsiskiyo00well that appears to have been published in 1881 which typically places it in the public domain. nonetheless, please send your request. thank you., bob july 8, 2015 at 7:23 pm how do you download anything?
