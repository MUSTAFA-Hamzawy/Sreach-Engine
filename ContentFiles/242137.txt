scheduled. information shared during the session is confidential., at the first meeting, the counsellor will ask questions about the individual’s situation. the counsellor assists the gambler to deal with urgent, immediate issues first. this might include establishing controls to limit spending or access to money, discussing ways to avoid gambling venues and dealing with urgent emotional, family, legal, work or school issues. the counsellor may have the client provide written information to gain a clear understanding of the difficulties the client is facing., the counsellor may recommend a plan of action that includes a certain number of sessions and topics for discussion. these topics may include financial management, stress reduction, family communication skills, alternative recreational activities, the role of gamblers anonymous, and practical ideas on how to avoid “triggers” to gambling. the counsellor may suggest other professional resources to assist with specific problem areas such as legal problems, financial crisis or severe depression. individuals seeking assistance are free to accept or reject the recommendations of counsellors and to suggest other ideas that might be effective., you have the option to change counsellors if you are dissatisfied., gam-anon information for the general public and professional community about problem (compulsive) gambling
