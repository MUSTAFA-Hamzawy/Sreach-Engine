[, report problems or direct any questions here., the minor planet center (mpc) is the single worldwide location for receipt and distribution of positional measurements of minor planets, comets and outer irregular natural satellites of the major planets. the mpc is responsible for the identification, designation and orbit computation for all of these objects. this involves maintaining the master files of observations and orbits, keeping track of the discoverer of each object, and announcing discoveries to the rest of the world via electronic circulars and an extensive website. the mpc operates at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory, under the auspices of division f of the international astronomical union (iau)., all of the mpc's operating funds come from a nasa near-earth object observations program grant. much of the computer equipment that the mpc uses was provided by the tamkin foundation., , , ][the international astronomical union minor planet center, running tallies, near-earth objects discovered, minor planets discovered, comets discovered, observations, close approaches]iau minor planet center[][home, about, contact, observers ephemeris service mpecs neo confirmation possible comet confirmation orbital elements mpcorb mpcat mpcupdate orbital elements for software publications overview publications archive neo services confirmation ratings observation planning aid neochecker neocmtchecker neocp followup report form neocp followup reports neocp recent observations other observer services observing target list natural satellite ephemerides new object ephemerides mpchecker cmtchecker distant artificial satellites observing list customizer orbits/observations database light curve database mpcat-obs sky coverage documentation mpc submission info astrometry guide what's new lists and plots minor planets comets observatory codes animations mpc status 2014-18 neo obs statistics summary of latest data, ephemeris service, mpecs, neo confirmation, possible comet confirmation, orbital elements mpcorb mpcat mpcupdate orbital elements for software, mpcorb, mpcat, mpcupdate, orbital elements for software, publications overview, publications archive, neo services confirmation ratings observation planning aid neochecker neocmtchecker neocp followup report form neocp followup reports neocp recent observations, confirmation, ratings, observation planning aid, neochecker, neocmtchecker, neocp followup report form, neocp followup reports, neocp recent observations, other observer services observing target list natural satellite ephemerides new object ephemerides mpchecker cmtchecker distant artificial satellites observing list customizer, observing target list, natural satellite ephemerides, new object ephemerides, mpchecker, cmtchecker, distant artificial satellites, observing list customizer, orbits/observations database, light curve database, mpcat-obs, sky coverage, documentation mpc submission info astrometry guide what's new, mpc submission info, astrometry guide, what's new, lists and plots minor planets comets observatory codes animations, minor planets, comets, observatory codes, animations, mpc status, 2014-18 neo obs statistics, summary of latest data, data, iawn, beta, status, sbn annex, home, about, contact, privacy]
