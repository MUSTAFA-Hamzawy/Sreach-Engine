[.&& among the pairs of words writers often confuse.&& affect and effect might be the most perplexing.&& perhaps because their meanings are so similar. affect.&& derived from affectus.&& from the latin word afficere.&& “to do something to.&& act on.&&” is easily conflated with effect.&& borrowed from anglo-french.&& ultimately stemming from the latin word effectus.&& from efficere.&& “to bring about.”.&& affect is usually a verb.&& meaning to influence or act upon. example:.&& the loss of his father affected him profoundly..&& effect is usually a noun.&& meaning the result of an action. example:.&& what will be the effect of closing main street?.&& below you will find less common meanings and related or derivative words..&& the various senses of affect.&& each followed by a sentence demonstrating them.&& follow:.&& a noun meaning “mental state”: “in his report.&& the psychiatrist.&& noting his lack of expression or other signs of emotion.&& described his affect as flat.”.&& a verb meaning “to produce an effect.&& to influence”: “i knew that my opinion would affect her choice.&& so i deliberately withheld it.”.&& a verb meaning “to pretend” or “to put on”: “she tried to affect an air of nonchalance.&& though she was visibly agitated.”.&& words with affect as the root.&& followed by their use in a sentence.&& include the following:.&& affectation: a noun meaning “self-conscious behavior”: “the girl’s affectation of sophisticated maturity was undercut by the relentless snapping of her chewing gum.”.&& affection: a noun meaning “kind or loving emotion”: “her grandfather’s deep affection for her was obvious in his heartwarming smile.”.&& disaffected: an adjective meaning “discontented.&& rebellious”: “disaffected youth dismayed by the poor job market and the larger issue of a society that does not seem to value them have been joining the protest movement in ever greater numbers.” (this word is a case of an antonym that has outlived the original term from which it was derived in counterpoint; writers and speakers no longer express.&& in the sense of “favorably disposed.&&” that a person is affected.).&& unaffected: an adjective with two distinct senses: the literal meaning of “not influenced or altered” (“they seemed disturbingly unaffected by the tragic news”) and the surprisingly older.&& figurative meaning “genuine” (“the youth’s candid.&& unaffected demeanor appealed to her after the stilted arrogance of her many suitors”)..&& the various senses of effect.&& each followed by a sentence demonstrating them.&& follow:.&& a noun meaning “the result of a cause”: “the effect of the lopsided vote was a loss of confidence in the chairman.”.&& a noun meaning “an impression”: “the soft.&& gentle tone has a calming effect.”.&& a noun.&& usually in plural form.&& meaning “personal property.&& possession”: “among the effects found in the deceased man’s pockets was a small book with his name self-inscribed.”.&& a verb meaning “to accomplish”: “his newfound sense of responsibility effected a positive change in her attitude toward him.”.&& words with effect as the root.&& followed by their use in a sentence.&& include the following:.&& aftereffect: a noun.&& usually in plural form.&& meaning “something that follows a cause”: “the aftereffects of the decision are still being felt years later.”.&& effective: an adjective meaning “successful”: “the insect repellent was effective at keeping the mosquitoes at bay.&& which made for a pleasant outing.”.&& effectual: an adjective meaning “able to produce a desired effect”: “our conclusion is that mediation is an effectual strategy for obtaining a mutually satisfying outcome.”.&& the noun efficiency and the adjective efficient.&& though not based on the root effect.&& share its etymological origin and mean.&& respectively.&& “productivity” and “productive” in the sense of accomplishing something with a minimum of effort in relation to outcome. efficacy (“the power to produce a desired effect”) and efficacious (“able to produce a desired effect”) are also related. another.&& unexpected word of related origin is feckless (“weak.&& worthless”).&& which is rare and has lost its antonym.&& feckful.&& through long disuse. feck is a shortened form of effect developed in scottish english..&& …tariff winners and losers: how trump’s trade spat could affect shoppers.

front of)..&& this doesn’t apply all the time.&& of course – as we’ve seen above.&& there are lots of ways in which the words “effect” and “affect” can be used. it’s a good place to begin.&& though.&& if you’re unsure which you want..&& here’s a sample sentence:.&& i don’t think this will [affect/effect] the budget..&& which word.&& affect or effect.&& is correct?.&& an easy way to figure this out is to replace “affect” with the verb “alter” and see if the sentence works:.&& i don’t think this will alter the budget..&& yes – it still makes sense.&& so “affect” is the word you want..&& here’s another sentence:.&& we haven’t yet experienced the full [affect/effect] of climate change..&& can we use “affect” here? try replacing it with “alter”:.&& we haven’t yet experienced the full alter of climate change..&& no.&& that doesn’t make sense at all..&& how about “effect”? try replacing that with the noun “end result”:.&& we haven’t yet experienced the full end result of climate changes..&& it’s a slightly inelegant sentence – but it does work grammatically. so “effect” is the word you want here..&& this rule won’t work for every single situation.&& but in most cases.&& it’ll help you quickly select the word that you want..&& it’s fairly rare to come across “affect” used as a noun: as we saw above.&& when it is used in this way.&& it means “mental state”. you might encounter it in some older works or fairly scientific ones about psychiatry..&& it’s a little more common to come across “effect” used as a verb.&& though this is still fairly rare and it can seem a little old-fashioned in this context. it’s used to mean “brought about” or “accomplished” – e.g. “the rapid changes she made after she got the job effected a complete turnaround in the company’s financial position.”.&& in any case where you’re uncertain.&& though.&& it’s likely that affect is a verb (replace it with “alter” to check) and effect is a noun (replace it with “end result” to check)..&& for each sentence.&& select which word should be used:.&& 1. the budget cuts will inevitably [affect/effect] our department..&& 2. the [affect/effect] of getting up early is that you can make a great
