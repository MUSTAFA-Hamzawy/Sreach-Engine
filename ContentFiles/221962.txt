'a gwas in latin americans identifies novel face shape loci, implicating vps13b and a denisovan introgressed region in facial variation', science advances volume 7 (2021), claimed as one of the most significant discoveries in the field of human evolution, the fossils possibly represent the oldest known human ancestor after the split of the human line from that of the chimpanzees. however, this is hotly debated., the only species in this genus, this hominin lived about 3 million years ago. however, the species name is based on a distorted and fragmented skull and many debate its validity., current use of the term ‘hominid’ can be confusing because the definition of this word has changed over time., this species is one of the best known of our ancestors., archaeological evidence shows that modern humans had reached southeast asia by 70,000 years ago, however the oldest securely dated modern human remains are only about 40,000 years old., a. anamensis is the earliest known australopithecine and lived over 4 million years ago., discovered in the 1990s, this is one of the earliest of our hominin ancestors yet discovered., human evolution is the biological and cultural development and change of our hominin ancestors to modern humans., examining the skulls of living apes and our extinct ancestors allows us to explore characteristics which reflect the evolutionary relationships in our family tree., sticks and stones picked up unaltered from the ground were probably the only implements used by the great apes and earliest human ancestors., reconstructing the physical environment in which our ancestors lived allows us to gain a greater understanding of their day-to-day lives. environments on both local and broader scales are greatly affected by climate, so climate change is an important area of study in reconstructing past environments, neanderthals co-existed with modern humans for long periods of time before eventually becoming extinct about 28,000 years ago. the unfortunate stereotype of these people as dim-witted and brutish cavemen still lingers in popular ideology but research has revealed a more nuanced picture., the australian museum

(homo sapiens) to inhabit europe. these hunter-gatherers lived a physically demanding lifestyle that would have required greater body strength than the average human today. their recent african ancestry may have also affected their height, as tall, long-limbed builds are useful adaptations to the warmer african climate., 10,000 years ago: european males – 162.5cm (5 ft 4 inches). a dramatic reduction in the size of humans occurred at this time. many scientists think that this reduction was influenced by global climatic change and the adoption of agriculture. agricultural communities suffered from malnutrition as a result of failed crops and a more restricted diet. furthermore, a close association with domestic livestock introduced new diseases into human populations., 600 years ago: european males – 165 cm (5 ft 5 inches). poor diet and health were the main causes for the shorter stature at this time., today: european males – 175 cm (5ft 9 inches). there has been an increase in height over the last few hundred years. in part, this increase is due to improved diet and health care. there may also be a genetic link as industrial expansion and urbanisation has brought together genetically isolated people and reduced the impacts of inbreeding due to a greater mixing of populations and their genes., 100,000 years ago: average brain size: 1500cc, 12,000 years ago: average brain size: 1450cc, today: average brain size: 1350cc, body builds: short, stocky builds are typical of humans living in cold climates. the reduced surface area compared to weight allows more body heat to be retained. a thin, long-limbed build is typical of humans in hot regions. the larger skin surface compared to weight allows for body heat to be lost more easily., skin colour: lighter skin allows the penetration of the sun’s uv rays. these rays help the body to synthesise vitamin d. darker skin protects the body from absorbing too many uv rays. this can cause cancer or destroy important vitamins and minerals., noses: people living in hot, humid climates tend to have broad, flat noses that allow inhaled air to be moistened and the moisture in exhaled air to be retained. people living in hot, dry climates typically have narrowed, projecting noses. this type of nose reduces the amount of water that is lost from the lungs during breathing. people living in cold, dry climates generally have smaller, longer and narrower noses. this type of nose moistens and warms the incoming air., hair: tight, curly hair keeps the hair off the neck and exposes more areas of the scalp than straight hair. this helps with cooling and evaporation of sweat. straight hair is common in people living in colder climates as it keeps the neck and head warm. straight hair also allows cold moisture to run off the scalp more easily., face shape: inuits have adapted to extreme cold by retaining layers of fat on their faces for additional warmth. populations in northern asia and the arctic tend to have broad, flat faces as these reduce the effects of frostbite., mouth shape: thick lips have a larger surface area to help evaporate moisture and cool the body. the larger surface also allows cooling by moistening of the lips., eyes: the epicanthic fold common among northern and eastern asian populations is an adaptation for protecting the eye from the hard driving snow typical in these regions, and also to reduce snow glare. blue eyes are better adapted for vision in regions where there is reduced light, as they let in more light than darker coloured eyes., additional: australian aboriginals of the central desert have an unusual physical adaptation to living in a climate where it can be freezing for short periods, such as during cold desert nights. they have evolved the ability to drop their bodies to low temperatures without triggering the usual reflex of shivering., homo erectus, how do we know if they could speak?, australopithecus garhi, humans are mammals,
