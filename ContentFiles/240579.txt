structured this policy to make it as easy to follow as possible. please keep information from the following policy sections top of mind as you use the twitter api and twitter content:.&& we’ve provided a lot more detail on what each of these three key sections mean below. please review them carefully to ensure that your usage of the twitter api and twitter content is consistent with our
