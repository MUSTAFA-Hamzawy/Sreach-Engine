[most breast cancer is treated with surgery, often along with additional treatments to help rid the body of cancer cells, or to ensure that it remains cancer-free., your doctor will determine a treatment plan based on the type of breast cancer you have, its stage, and how aggressive the cancer is., treatment options may include one or more of the following:, rather than remove an entire breast, surgeons perform a lumpectomy to remove a small portion of the breast in which there is a tumor., even though it's the least invasive breast cancer surgery, lumpectomy can be very effective. in some cases, the procedure can prevent further surgery., if more tissue needs to be removed than in a lumpectomy, your surgeon may perform a partial mastectomy., in a partial mastectomy, the surgeon may remove a whole segment or quadrant of breast tissue, and possibly some of the lining over the chest muscles., mastectomy is a term used for several different procedures. in many cases, it means fully removing one or both breasts., a mastectomy can also include removing lymph nodes in the armpit area if the cancer has spread there, or is at risk of spreading to the area., mastectomy may be an effective treatment option for several types of breast cancer, including:, also called radiotherapy, radiation uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells that remain in the breast, chest wall, or underarm area after surgery., generally speaking, radiation only affects cells in the area of the body that is being treated., chemotherapy involves using a combination of drugs to destroy cancer cells or slow down their growth., it is usually administered intravenously (by iv) and in an outpatient setting. chemotherapy can be given before or after breast cancer surgery, depending on your condition., your doctor will determine if chemotherapy is right for you based on the following factors:, if your type of cancer is found to be sensitive to hormones, hormone (or hormonal) therapy may be recommended to slow or stop the growth of tumors., this therapy works by interfering with the body's ability to produce or respond to hormones., hormone therapy can be used to shrink and control cancer, or to prevent your cancer from returning after other treatments are completed., hormone therapy for cancer is different from hormone therapy used to help with symptoms of menopause., treatments that can be used in hormone therapy include:, biologic targeted therapy uses drugs that can alter the behavior of breast cancer cells., some of these drugs include:, immunotherapy is a type of medicine that primes the immune system to recognize and respond to cancer cells as foreign invaders and kill them. this has been approved in a subset of patients with triple negative breast cancer. the most commonly used immunotherapy drugs in this case include:, most women who have had all or part of a breast removed can have their breast (or breasts) rebuilt to match the size and shape of the other breast or their original breasts., the nipple and areola (dark area of skin around the nipple) can also be reconstructed., over the past decade, there have been significant achievements in breast reconstruction. reconstructed breasts are often outwardly indistinguishable from a woman's original breasts., by subscribing you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy., 5 longtime breast
