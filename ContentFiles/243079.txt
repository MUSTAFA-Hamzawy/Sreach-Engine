[ive been working on anna e dickinson family correspondence.  she refers to her mother by a nickname that some transcribe as marmee and others maumee.  ive been going with marmee because the only published book i could find (americas joan of arc: the life of anna e. dickinson)  referenced her as marmee..&&  .&& i do think it looks a lot more like maumee at times so i emailed the author to ask him about it.  he said he always transcribed it as marmee but that he really wasnt sure..&&  .&& if anybody has insight.&& please let me know.  im happy go to back and change my transcriptions if they are wrong..&&  .&& margaret.&& more great detective work! could you share a link or two to some examples?
