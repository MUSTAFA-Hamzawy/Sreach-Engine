[meditation is part of the modern-day wellness lexicon, but the truth is, the practice has been around for millennia., “meditation dates back thousands of years across many different cultures, and often shares elements with spirituality,” says jillian cohen, md, an integrative medicine expert at weill cornell medicine in new york city. “in modern times, meditation is used often as an effective means of managing stress, anxiety, insomnia, and pain, among other chronic conditions.”, in its simplest terms, meditation is the practice of deepening one’s awareness or focusing one’s mind for a period of time., some of the earliest evidence of meditation includes wall art from the indus valley that dates back to between 5,000 and 3,500 bce. the images illustrate people sitting on the ground with their legs crossed, hands on their knees and eyes resting — in positions widely recognized as meditation postures., , there’s no one single type of meditation, though techniques tend to overlap. “you can think of meditation like sports,” says diana winston, a mindfulness meditation teacher and director of mindfulness education at ucla’s mindful awareness research program. “it’s a huge category. just like there are so many different types of sports, there are so many varieties of meditation.”, here’s a list of common types of meditation and how they are practiced., mindfulness meditation this is the process of being fully present with what you are experiencing in the current moment — including your body and your thoughts — in a way that is concentrated, curious, and open. “i define mindfulness as paying attention to our present moment experiences with an openness, curiosity, and a willingness to be without experience,” winston says. “it’s a way of helping us live more in the present moment, not being lost in the past and future.”, , , , concentrative meditation different than mindfulness meditation, which encourages being present in a curious and open way, concentrative meditation keeps the mind fixated on one object, like the body as it sits on a chair. “it typically has you focus on one thing in order to concentrate, gather your focus, and calm your mind,” winston says., , , guided meditation another method of concentrative meditation, in which you form mental pictures of situations that you find relaxing. “you might imagine that you’re in a beautiful garden with the birds chirping,” winston says. “so you’re using your imagination to create states of being.”, loving-kindness and compassion meditation the practice of directing well wishes toward others and wishes to help oneself or another to suffer less. “you may wish them happiness or peace or that they’re at ease, and what that does is it may affect the other person, but it’s really about cultivating it within ourselves,” winston explains., , winston notes that certain activities such as running or drawing, while not considered forms of meditation, can produce a meditative state for many people., “i think of it as you’re using art or running to help create a meditative approach or meditative mind, but it’s not in and of itself a meditation,” she says., learn more about the types of meditation, in recent years, a growing body of research has focused on how meditation affects the brain., some studies suggest that practicing mindfulness meditation can actually change the structures of the brain. while scientists are still working to understand the effects of this practice, it is generally believed that it correlates to improved emotional regulation., “mindfulness meditation has been shown to activate the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with our higher cognitive functions, and deactivate the amygdala, an area of the brain associated with anger, fear, anxiety, and depression,” dr. cohen says. “it strengthens the neurological circuits that calm the part of the brain that acts as a trigger for fear and anger.”, , , , learn more about how meditation changes the brain, a growing body of research has found that meditation is beneficial to mental and physical health because of the effect it has on our stress response., “the primary health benefit from meditation appears to be related to the general shift in the autonomic nervous system that decreases sympathetic tone and increases parasympathetic tone,” cohen says., the sympathetic nervous system is our fight-or-flight response, while our parasympathetic nervous system is rest-and-digest, she says., “as humans, we’re wired to fight-or-flight very easily, since it’s a survival mechanism,” cohen explains. “so we want and need more parasympathetic. when the parasympathetic system is stimulated, heart rate and breathing slow, stress hormones decrease, blood vessels dilate, and digestion is improved.”, in recent years, a growing body of scientific evidence has shown how a meditation practice can help improve health, including mental and emotional health., , , , learn more about the effects of meditation on mental health, meditation can also be a helpful tool in managing chronic illnesses. while research is limited, and larger, more long-term studies are needed, there’s some evidence that meditation may play a role in helping manage various conditions — from mental health disorders to chronic pain to skin ailments., chronic stress promotes an increased inflammatory load, chronic low-grade inflammation, and prolonged increased levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) — “all of which are associated with increased chronic illness,” cohen says., for instance, meditation may help you manage or improve:, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , learn more about how meditation can help with chronic illnesses, there are many different ways to meditate. popular forms of meditation include mindfulness meditation, concentrative meditation, mantra meditation, guided meditation, and meditative movements like yoga and tai chi., meditation is an ancient practice that is used today as a form of mind-body complementary medicine that increases calmness and relaxation. research suggests that meditation may help reduce stress, boost mood, improve emotional and mental health, and aid the management of a number of chronic illnesses., there are many different ways to meditate, but generally, you’ll want to find a quiet place, sit or lie down in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and pay attention to what is present, such as your breath, bodily sensations, and other senses., choosing a mantra for meditation is highly individualized. a common mantra is a simple syllable like “om.” a mantra can also be a simple sentence stating a goal, such as “i am calm.”, some studies suggest that certain people experience anxiety after meditating, though it’s unclear why. factors at play include the intensity of the practice, the competence of the teacher, and whether the individual is predisposed to mental health disorders., while research has shown that there are certainly many health benefits of meditation, not everyone will necessarily experience those positive effects., indeed, some research finds that certain individuals may have negative experiences when meditating., a meta-analysis of four decades of studies on meditation and mindfulness determined that these practices led to negative effects in about 8 percent of people. the most common adverse effects were increases in anxiety, depression, and stress., , cohen theorizes that people with mental health disorders like depression and anxiety may be more susceptible to feelings of inadequacy if they don't feel like they’re getting meditation “right.”, “because meditation reminds us that we all to varying degrees have psychological agency — that we can shift our own attitudes and thought processes — there can potentially be those who are suffering with psycho-emotional imbalances, such as depression or anxiety, who may experience shame or self-deprecation when results are not realized at the same pace as others, or at the pace they might expect,” she says. “this can cause many feelings of guilt or inadequacy.”, , , while more research is needed in this area, experts say it’s important to note that meditation, just like any other practice, is not for everyone., “sometimes, there’s an assumption that meditation is going to solve all my problems,” winston says. “but medically there’s no medication that works for everybody, and there’s no meditation that works for everybody.”, if you’ve tried meditation and have found that it’s not for you, there are plenty other avenues to explore that can help alleviate stress and anxiety., “the most important thing is that we can all find ways to reduce stress in our lives, whether that’s running or dancing or taking long walks in nature, and not to assume that you’ve got to be a meditator in order to reduce stress,” winston says., if you’re new to meditation, you may find the practice intimidating. luckily, once you know the basics, you can practice meditation just about anywhere at any time., experts recommend the following tips to get started:, explore different types of meditation. it’s helpful for beginners to explore the different forms of meditation to find the one they like best, winston says. read about the various types and see where you might like to get started. “there’s a whole variety to experiment with,” winston says. “if one doesn’t work for you or you don’t respond to it, try another one.”, find a teacher. find a certified meditation instructor by going to medical centers in your area and checking with the integrative medicine or psychology departments and asking for recommendations. if you find an instructor on your own, do your homework and make sure they are certified. the international mindfulness teachers association has listings of teachers who have gone through accredited teacher training programs. if you’re interested in trying a meditation group, check out the buddhist insight network., use tools to practice meditation on your own. if you prefer not to go to an instructor or there are no certified teachers in your area, you can still practice meditation on your own. go to your local library and find a book on meditation, or download one of the many meditation apps to your mobile phone or tablet. “it’s not a regulated industry, so it’s best to use something that you see has a high adoption rate or if you can get a recommendation from a trusted friend,” winston says., don’t get discouraged. oftentimes people will try meditation and feel like they’re failing because they can’t concentrate or do it “right.” this is normal. “for most people, meditation does not come easily,” winston says. “we live in a state of perpetual distraction, and it’s so hard to stay focused.” the key is to start out slow and keep your expectations in check. “you can try meditating for five minutes, or you can try for one minute,” winston says. “there’s not a set time that you have to do it to feel the effects.”, if you’re interested in trying meditation, winston recommends the following five-minute exercise to get started:, learn more about how to
