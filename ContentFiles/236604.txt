[the pending sale of twitter to elon musk has generated a buzz about the future of social media and just who should control our data..&& wendy hanamura.&& director of partnerships at the internet archive.&& moderated an online discussion april 28 “goodbye facebook.&& hello decentralized social media?” about the opportunities and dangers ahead. the webinar is part of a series of six workshops.&& “imagining a better online world: exploring the decentralized web.” .&& watch the session recording:.&& the session featured founders of some of the top decentralized social media networks including jay graber.&& chief executive officer of r&d project bluesky.&& matthew hodgson.&& technical co-founder of matrix.&& and andre staltz.&& creator of manyverse. unlike twitter.&& facebook or slack.&& matrix and manyverse have no central controlling entity. instead the peer-to-peer networks shift power to the users and protect privacy. .&& if twitter is indeed bought and people are disappointed with the changes.&& the speakers expressed hope that the public will consider other social networks. “a crisis of this type means that people start installing manyverse and other alternatives.&&” staltz said. “the opportunity side is clear.” still in the transition period if other platforms are not ready.&& there is some risk that users will feel stuck and not switch.&& he added..&& hodgson said there are reasons to be both optimistic and pessimistic about musk purchasing twitter. the hope is that he will use his powers for good.&& making it available to everybody and empowering people to block the content they don’t want to see. the risk is with no moderation.&& hodgson said.&& people will be obnoxious to one another without sufficient controls to filter.&& and the system will melt down. “it’s certainly got potential to be an experiment. i’m cautiously optimistic on it.&&” he said..&& people who work in decentralized tech recognize the risk that comes when one person can control a network and act for good or bad.&& graber said. “this turn of events demonstrates that social networks that are centralized can change very quickly.&&” she said. “those changes can potentially disrupt or drastically alter people’s identity.&& relationships.&& and the content that they put on there over the years. this highlights the necessity for transition to a protocol-based ecosystem.” .&& when a platform is user-controlled.&& it is resilient to disruptive change.&& graber said. decentralization enables immutability so change is hard and is a slow process that requires a lot of people to agree.&& added staltz..&& the three leaders spoke about how decentralized networks provide a sustainable alternative and are gaining traction. unlike major players that own user data and monetize personal information.&& decentralized networks are controlled by users and information lives in many different places..&& “society as a whole is facing a lot of crises.&&” graber said. “we have the ability to.&& as a collective intelligence.&& to investigate a lot of directions at once. but we don’t actually have the free ability to fully do this in our current social architecture…if you decentralize.&& you get the ability to innovate and explore many more directions at once. and all the parts get more freedom and autonomy.”.&& decentralized social media is structured to change the balance of power.&& added hanamura: “in this moment.&& we want you to know that you have the power. you can take back the power.&& but you have to understand it and understand your responsibility.”.&& the webinar was co-sponsored by dweb and library futures.&& and presented by the metropolitan new york library council (metro)..&& the next event in the series.&& decentralized apps.&& the metaverse and the “next big thing.&&” will be held thursday.&& may 26 at 4-5 p.m.est.&& register here.&& .&& join us on tuesday.&& may 31st at 6pm pt / 9pm et for a fireside chat with congressman ro khanna in conversation with harvard professor and author lawrence lessig to discuss rep. khanna’s book.&& dignity in a digital age: making tech work for all of us..&& in the bay area? you can join us at our san francisco headquarters in person!

the media’s spotlight. in this briefing.&& i will discuss recent research on the applications of ai to monetary policy communications.&& and lessons learned to date. in particular.&& i will report on my recent ongoing project with researchers at the bank of canada that analyzes the effects of emotional cues by the chairs of the u.s. federal reserve on financial markets during congressional testimonies.  .&& while most previous work has mainly focused on the effects of a central bank’s highly scripted messages about its rate decisions delivered by its leader.&& we use resources from the internet archive.&& cspan and copies of testimony transcripts and apply a variety of tools and techniques to study the both the messages and the messengers’ delivery of them. i will review how we apply recent advances in machine learning and big data to construct measures of federal reserve chair’s emotions.&& expressed via his or her words.&& voice.&& and face.&& as well as discuss challenges encountered and our findings to date. in all.&& our initial results highlight the salience of the fed chair’s emotional cues for shaping market responses to fed communications. understanding the

berkeley).&& in december 2018.&& tumblr took down massive amounts of lgbtq content from its platform. motivated in part by increasing pressures from financial institutions and a newly passed law — sesta / fosta.&& which made companies liable for sex trafficking online — tumblr implemented a strict “not safe for work” or nsfw model.&& whose false positives included images of fully clothed women.&& handmade and digital art.&& and other innocuous objects.&& such as vases. the archive team.&& in conjunction with the internet archive.&& jumped into high gear and began to scrape self-tagged nsfw blogs in the 2 weeks between tumblr’s announcement of its new policy and its algorithmic operationalization. at the time.&& tumblr was considered a safe haven for the lgbtq community and in 2013 yahoo! bought tumblr for 1.1 billion. in the aftermath of the so-called “tumblr purge.&&” tumblr lost its main user base and.&& as of 2019.&& was valued at 3 million. this paper digs into a slice of the 90 tb of data saved by the archive team. this is a unique opportunity to peek under the hood of yahoo’s open_nsfw model.&& which experts believe was used in the tumblr purge.&& and examine the distribution of false positives on the archive team dataset. specifically.&& we run the open_nsfw model on our dataset and use the t-sne algorithm to project the similarities across images on 3d

linked to the book where it first appeared at the internet archive. “japan as they saw it” can be read online.&& or it can be downloaded as a free ebook..&& tom gally (university of tokyo).&& novels were the binge-watched television.&& the hit podcasts of the 19th century—immersive.&& addictive.&& commercial—and they were produced and consumed in huge numbers. but many novels of that era have slipped through the cracks of literary memory. “forgotten novels of the 19th century” is a list of fifty of those neglected novels.&& all waiting to be discovered and read for free at the internet

gap”.&& the looming threat of ai and automation.&& social mobility.&& and the underrepresentation of women and people of color in the tech industry. in response to this widespread discourse.&& an entire industry of short-term intensive training courses– otherwise known as coding bootcamps– have sprung up across the us.&& bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue a year and

provide  useful  organizational  structure  to  large  volumes  of  data.  however.&&  construction of  these  hierarchies  is  difficult  using  established  ontologies  (e.g.  wordnet)  due  to the differences in the semantic and pragmatic use of words vs. hashtags in social media. while alternative construction methods based on hashtag frequency are relatively straightforward.&& these methods can be susceptible to the dynamic nature of social media.&&  such  as  hashtags  associated  with  surges  in  popularity.  we  drew  inspiration  from the ecologically-based shannon diversity index (sdi) to create a more representative and  resilient  method  of  semantic  hierarchy  construction  that  relies  upon  graph-based community detection and a novel.&& entropy-based ensemble diversity index (edi) score. the edi quantifies the contextual diversity of each hashtag.&& resulting in thousands of semantically-related groups of hashtags organized along a general-to-specific spectrum. through an application of edi to social media data (twitter) and a comparison of our results to prior approaches.&& we demonstrate our method’s ability to create semantically consistent hierarchies that can be flexibly applied and adapted to a range of use cases..&& emmanouil tranos (university of bristol).&& while geographers first turned their focus on the internet 25 years ago.&& the wealth of data that the internet archive preserves and offers remains at large unexplored.&& especially for large projects in terms of scope and geographical scale. however.&& there is hardly any other data source that depicts the evolution of our interaction with the digital and.&& importantly.&& the spatial footprint of this interaction better than the internet archive. therefore.&& the last few years we have been using extensively data from the internet archive in order to understand the geography and the evolution of the creation of online content and their interrelation with cities and spatial structure. specifically.&& we have worked with the british library and utilised the jisc uk web domain dataset (1996-2013)1 for a number of projects in order to (i) explore whether the availability of online content of local interest can attract individuals online.&& (ii) assess how the early engagement with web tools can affect future productivity.&& (iii) map the evolution of economic clusters.&& and (iv) predict interregional trade flows. the internet archive helps us not only to map the evolution and the geography of the engagement with the internet especially at its early stages and.&& therefore.&& draw important lessons regarding new future technologies.&& but also to understand economic activities that take place within and between cities. 1http://data.webarchive.org.uk/opendata/ukwa.ds.2/.&& guest post by: tricia dean.&& tech services manager at wilmington public library district (il).&& this post is part of a series written by members of the community webs program. community webs advances the capacity for community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories and underrepresented voices. for more information.&& visit communitywebs.archive-it.org/.&& i was excited when i saw the call for participants in community webs. while wilmington.&& illinois is a small.&& rural town (5.&&664 people).&& the thought was that we still had something to contribute. most archive-it partners are universities.&& museums and large libraries.&& and being in their company was a little daunting to me initially. other institutions have someone who opens the project.&& and then it develops into a larger team project. wilmington public library district (wpld) has a much smaller staff; the project has been wholly mine.&& which has been both thrilling and terrifying. .&& wilmington is a small rural town.&& falling on the lower end of the economic scale.  because we are isolated.&&the library plays a vital part in the community.  we offer the usual storytimes and adult programs.&& but also loan out hotspots and chromebooks. we have 45 hotspots and these are almost always checked out; some people are using them for vacations.&& but by usage it is apparent that others are using them as their primary means of connecting to the internet. internet access has been more and more important.&& but after the covid-19 broke out.&& more governmental services went strictly online.&& making access even more critical – and to many who had not been regular patrons. wpld is a hub for the community.&& offering computers.&& information.&& tax forms.&& and a place to come in and chat – even more important when we are trying to stay close and limit outside contact..&& i am a chicago native who went to champaign-urbana for grad school. i was a scanner for the internet archive for several years where i was privileged to handle some incunabula (pre-1500 items). i am the technical services supervisor at wilmington; primarily i catalog our materials.&& but i also tend toward projects.&& from adding series labels to re-orienting all the calls in the juvenile non-fiction section.  i am currently going through our attic to help determine what we have (it’s a mystery!). i’m making lists.&& and hoping to have items to scan which would be available online.&& in multiple places. i applied for the community webs program (with my director’s blessing) because i felt that it’s important for small towns to be represented in the collection of history. only 20% of the population still lives outside major metro areas.&& but it is every bit as important to capture that life as it is to retain the history of large cities..&& wilmington library joined community webs in the summer of 2021. after some technical clarifications with the archive-it staff wlpd was set up. in considering what made wilmington unique.&& the first link was to our library and social media pages. social media has grown in importance in the last twenty years.&& but it became a vital link during covid when services were otherwise unavailable. wilmington library youtube videos.&& how-tos.&& crafts and storytime.&& stand to remind us of how we responded and as a continuing reference for parents who can’t get to the library. but since social media.&& specifically.&& is known for ‘right now.&&’ it lacks the kind of reflection over time that we can create through the community webs project..&& we may be small.&& but we have a number of historical articles and sites which needed to be brought together. we want to reflect events that have been impactful to our community.&& from the explosion of the joliet armory in the 1940s to the continuing issues with the wilmington dam.&& which has proved dangerous.&& but has complicated ownership issues. i still have a long way to go; the projects (attic/local history/web archive) are all intertwined. wilmington has the usual community resources and city government collections in archive-it. going forward.&& we want to continue to develop our wilmington history collection. we are working on local history and will establish a collection of materials from our attic and public donations. our local paper has vertical files which could be a goldmine of information – again.&& on my to-do list.  we will be kicking off an oral history project.&& which will begin with a series of simple gatherings/coffee hours for our seniors.&& providing a place for them to gather.&& and a space to share their stories. i am hoping these will be in our community webs archive. who better to speak to where we’ve been and where we are than some of our oldest residents?.&& why is community webs important? because it will help to remember when we cannot keep up with the information overload. because there is so much happening that we miss a good deal of what is around us – or can’t bear to face it for long. because so very very much of our lives are now online – and can be erased with a keystroke. because we are seeing.&& painfully.&& that those who do not learn from the past will be/are condemned to re-live it. and.&& for wilmington.&& i think it is important because so many of the voices and sites being captured are from museums.&& universities and large public libraries. it is important that we remember that we used to be far less urban than we are today. it is important to remember the smaller places.&& those who are too easily lost in the maelstrom of modern life.&& because to be forgotten is to be erased..&& at a recent webinar hosted by the internet archive.&& leaders from the biodiversity heritage library (bhl) shared how its massive open access digital collection documenting life on the planet is an invaluable resource of use to scientists and ordinary citizens..&& “the bhl is a global consortium of the  leading natural history museums.&& botanical gardens.&& and research institutions — big and small— from all over the world. working together and in partnership with the internet archive.&& these libraries have digitized more than 60 million pages of scientific literature available to the

knowledge.&& bhl has 19 members and 22 affiliates.&& plus 100 worldwide partners contributing data. the bhl has content dating back nearly 600 years alongside current literature that.&& when liberated from the print page.&& holds immense promise for advancing science and solving today’s pressing problems of climate change and the loss of biodiversity..&& martin kalfatovic.&& bhl program director and associate director of the smithsonian libraries and archives.&& noted in his presentation that charles darwin and colleagues famously said “the cultivation of natural science cannot be efficiently carried on without reference to an extensive library.”.&& “today.&& the biodiversity heritage library is creating this global.&& accessible open library of literature that will  help scientists.&& taxonomists.&& environmentalists—a host of people working with our planet—to actually have ready access to these collections.&&” kalfatovic said. bhl’s mission is to improve research methodology by working with its partner libraries and the broader biodiversity and bioinformatics community. each month.&& bhl draws about 142.&&000 visitors and 12 million users overall..&& “the outlook for the planet is challenging. by unlocking this historic data [in the biodiversity heritage library].&& we can find out where we’ve been over time to find out more about where we need to be in the future.”.&& most of the bhl’s materials are from collections in the global north.&& primarily in large.&& well-funded institutions. digitizing these collections helps level the playing field.&& providing researchers in all parts of the world equal access to vital content..&& the vast collection includes species descriptions.&& distribution records.&& climate records.&& history of scientific discovery.&& information on extinct species.&& and records of scientific distributions of where species live. to date.&& bhl has made over 176.&&000 titles and 281.&&000 volumes available. through a partnership with the global names architecture project.&& more than 243 million instances of taxonomic (latin) names have been found in bhl content..&& kalfatovic underscored the value of bhl content in understanding the environment in the wake of recent troubling news from the sixth assessment report (ar6) published by the  intergovernmental panel on climate change about the impact of the earth’s warming. .&& “the outlook for the planet is challenging.&&” he said. “by unlocking this historic data.&& we can find out where we’ve been over time to find out more about where we need to be in the

medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote.&&” kahle said. “we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.” .&& the internet archive built on the work of the vanderbilt television archive.&& and the ucla library broadcast newsscape to give the public a broader “macro view.&&” said kahle. the trends seen in at-scale computational analyses of news broadcasts can be used to understand the bigger picture of what is happening in the world and the lenses through which we see the world around us..&& in 2012.&& with donations from individuals and philanthropies such as the knight foundation.&& the archive started repurposing the closed captioning data stream required of all u.s. broadcasters into a search index. “this simple approach transformed the antiquated experience of searching for specific topics within video.&&” said macdonald.&& who helped lead the effort. “the tv caption search enabled discovery at internet speed with the ability to simultaneously search millions of programs and have your results plotted over time.&& down to individual broadcasters and programs.”.&& “[television] is such an influential.&& important medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote. we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.”.&& scholars and journalists were quick to embrace this opportunity.&& but the team kept experimenting with deeper indexing. techniques like audio fingerprinting.&& optical character recognition (ocr) and computer vision made it possible to capture visual elements of the news and improve access.&& macdonald said. .&& sub-collections of political leaders’ speeches and interviews have been created.&& including an extensive donald trump archive. some of the archive’s most productive advances have come from collaborating with outsiders who have requested more access to the collection than is available through the public interface.&& macdonald said. with appropriate restrictions to maintain respect for broadcasters and distribution platforms.&& the archive has worked with select scientists and journalists as partners to use data in the collection for more complex analyses..&& treating television news as data creates vast opportunities for computational analysis.&& said leetaru. researchers can track word frequency use in the news and how that has changed over time.  for instance.&& it’s possible to look at mentions of covid-related words across selected news programs and see when it surged and leveled off with each wave before plummeting downward.&& as shown in the graph below..&& the newly computed metadata can help provide context and assist with fact checking efforts to combat misinformation. it can allow researchers to map the geography of television news—how certain parts of the world are covered more than others.&& leetaru said. through the collections.&& researchers have explored  which presidential tweets challenging election integrity got the most exposure on the news.  ocr of every frame has been used to create models of how to identify names of every “dr.” depicted on cable tv after the outbreak of covid-19 and

council.&& and library futures.&& how many passwords do you have saved.&& and how many of them are controlled by a large.&& corporate platform instead of by you? last month’s “keeping your personal data personal: how decentralized identity drives privacy” session started with that provocative question in order to illustrate the potential of this emerging technology..&& self-sovereign identity (ssi).&& defined as “an idea.&& a movement.&& and a decentralized approach for establishing trust online.&&” sits in the middle of the stack of technologies that makes up the decentralized internet. in the words of the decentralized identity resource guide written specifically for this session.&& “self-sovereign identity is a system where users themselves–and not centralized platforms or services like google.&& facebook.&& or linkedin–are in control and maintain ownership of their personal information.”.&&   research shows that the average american has more than 150 different accounts and passwords – a number that has likely skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic. in her presentation.&& wendy hanamura.&& director of partnerships at the internet archive.&& discussed the implications of “trading privacy and security for convenience.” hanamura drew on her recent experience at sxsw.&& which bundled her personal data.&& including medical and vaccine data.&& into an insecure qr code used by a corporate sponsor to verify her as a participant. in contrast.&& hanamura says that the twenty-year old concept of self-sovereign identity can disaggregate these services from corporations.&& empowering people to be in better control of their own data and identity through principles like control.&& access.&& transparency.&& and consent. while self-sovereign identity presents incredible promise as a concept.&& it also raises fascinating technical questions around verification and management..&& for kaliya “identity woman” young.&& her interest in identity comes from networks of global ecology and information technology.&& which she has been part of for more than twenty years. in 2000.&& when the internet was still nascent.&& she joined with a community to ask: “how can this technology best serve people.&& organizations.&& and the planet?” underlying her work is the strong belief that people should have the right to control their own online identity with the maximum amount of flexibility and access. using a real life example.&& young compared self-sovereign identity to a physical wallet. like a wallet.&& self-sovereign identity puts users in control of what they share.&& and when.&& with no centralized ability for an issuer to tell when the pieces of information within the wallet is presented..&& in contrast.&& the modern internet operates with a series of centralized identifiers like icann or iana for domain names and ip addresses and corporate private namespaces like google and facebook. young’s research and work decentralizes this way of transmitting information through “signed portable proofs.&&” which come from a variety of sources rather than one centralized source. these proofs are also called verifiable credentials and have metadata.&& the claim itself.&& and a digital signature embedded for validation. all of these pieces come together in a digital wallet.&& verified by a digital identifier that is unique to a person. utilizing cryptography.&& these identifiers would be validated by digital identity documents and registries. in this scenario.&& organizations like incommon.&& an access management service.&& or even a professional licensing organization like the american library association can maintain lists of institutions that would be able to verify the identity or organizational affiliation of an identifier. in the end.&& young emphasized a message of empowerment – in her work.&& self-sovereign identity is about “innovating protocols to represent people in the digital realm in ways that empower them and that they control.”.&& next.&& librarian lambert heller of technische bibliothek and irene adamski of the berlin-based ssi firm jolocom discussed and demonstrated their work in creating self-sovereign identity for academic conferences on a new platform called condidi. this tool allows people running academic events to have a platform that issues digital credentials of attendance in a decentralized system. utilizing open source and decentralized software.&& this system minimizes the amount of personal information that attendees need to give over to organizers while still allowing participants to track and log records of their attendance. for libraries.&& this kind of system is crucial – new systems like condidi help libraries protect user privacy and open up platform innovation..&& self-sovereign identity also utilizes a new tool called  a “smart wallet.&&” which holds one’s credentials and is controlled by the user. for example.&& at a conference.&& a user might want to tell the organizer that she is of age.&& but not share any other information about herself. a demo of jolocom’s system demonstrated how this system could work. in the demo.&& irene showed how a wallet could allow a person to share just the information she wants through encrypted keys in a conference situation. jolocom also allows people to verify credentials using an encrypted wallet. according to adamski.&& the best part of self sovereign identity is that “you don’t have to share if you don’t want to.” this way.&& “i am in control of my data.”.&& to conclude.&& heller discussed a recent movement in europe called “stop tracking science.” to combat publishing oligopolies and data analytics companies.&& a group of academics have come together to create scholar-led infrastructure. as heller says.&& in the current environment.&& “your journal is reading you.&&” which is a terrifying thought about scholarly communications..&& these academics are hoping to move toward shared responsibility and open.&& decentralized infrastructure using the major building blocks that already exist. one example of how academia is already decentralized is through pids.&& or persistent identifiers.&& which are already widely used through systems like orcid. according to heller.&& these pids are “part of the commons” and can be shared in a consistent.&& open manner across systems.&& which could be used in a decentralized manner for personal identity rather than a centralized one. to conclude.&& heller said.&& “there is no technical fix for social issues. we need to come up with a model for how trust works in research infrastructure.”.&& it is clear that self-sovereign identity holds great promise as part of a movement for technology that is privacy-respecting.&& open.&& transparent.&& and empowering. in this future.&& it will be possible to have a verified identity that is held by you.&& not by a big corporation – the vision that we are setting out to achieve. want to help us get there? .&& join us at the next events hosted by metro library council.&& internet archive.&& and library futures. https://metro.org/decentralizedweb.&& links shared.&&
