[video stabilization library.&& vidstab is a video stabilization library which can be plugged-in with ffmpeg and transcode..&& why is it needed.&& a video acquired using a hand-held camera or a camera mounted on a vehicle.&& typically suffers from undesirable shakes and jitters. activities such as surfing.&& skiing.&& riding and walking while shooting videos are especially prone to erratic camera shakes. vidstab targets these video contents to help create smoother and stable videos..&& some of the features include:.&& note: this readme focuses mainly on using vidstab with ffmpeg. see here for information regarding installation.&& usage and examples for using vidstab with transcode. or contact me at georg dot martius @ web dot de.&& for using vidstab library with ffmpeg.&& ffmpeg must to be configured using --enable-libvidstab option..&& before running ffmpeg for the first time.&& make sure to export ld_library_path to point to vidstab library.&& e.g..&&.&& currently with ffmpeg.&& vidstab library must run in two-pass mode. the first pass employs the vidstabdetect filter and the second pass uses the vidstabtransform filter..&& single pass filter with vidstab library is only available with transcode. the deshake filter of ffmpeg can be used for a single-pass encoding.&& though using the vidstab two-pass filters will give superior results..&& the vidstabdetect filter (in first pass) will generate a file with relative-translation and rotation-transform information about subsequent frames. this information will then be read by vidstabtransform filter (in second pass) to compensate for the jerky motions and produce a stable video output..&& make sure that you use unsharp filter provided by ffmpeg for best results (only in second pass)..&& see the list of ffmpeg filters to know more about vidstabdetect.&& vidstabtransform and all other filters available with ffmpeg..&& use default values:.&& -f null - makes sure that no output is produced as this is just the first pass. this in-turn results in faster speed..&& analyzing strongly shaky video and putting the results in file mytransforms.trf:.&& visualizing the result of internal transformations in the resulting video:.&& analyzing a video with medium shakiness:.&& using default values:.&& note the use of the ffmpegs unsharp filter which is always recommended..&& zooming-in a bit more and load transform data from a given file:.&& smoothening the video even more:.&& vidstab is an open source library -
