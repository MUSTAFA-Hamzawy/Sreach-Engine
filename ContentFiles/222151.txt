[this series is meant to teach about how science is done, from generating a hypothesis to designing an experiment to analyzing the results with statistics. you can repeat the steps of one of these experiments and compare your results — or use this as inspiration to design your own experiment., weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment, thank you for
