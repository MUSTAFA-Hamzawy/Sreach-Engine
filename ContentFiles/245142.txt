recognize letters and sounds from a to z.  focusing on the first 26 letters of the alphabet, and the essential sounds they make is a useful departure point for early literacy. explore our full range of preschool games., kindergarten phonics games level 1: our level 1 kindergarten phonics games help develop skills in recognizing and sounding out beginning and ending consonants. these gaming exercises also emphasize practice on short vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’, which are later combined with consonants to form word families such as ‘at’, and ‘et’ in words like bat and bet., kindergarten phonics games level 2: our level 2 kindergarten phonics games contain activities centered around all the short vowels, word families and several ending consonant sounds., first grade phonics games level 1: moving up to our 1st grade phonics games for level 1, students practice sounds such as consonant digraphs and s blends. we offer games to practice digraphs ch, sh, th, ph and more. others games review s and l blends as well as the soft c and g. , first grade phonics games level 2: under 1st grade phonics games level 2, you will find activities to practice vowel digraphs and long vowels. children in grade 1 will also develop skills in reading r blends and l blends. mastery of vowel digraphs such as ‘ai’, ‘ee’ and ‘ay’, which recur in several english words, will help supercharge children’s literacy skills. at this stage, you will find your child confidently reading short stories and reading road signs. they will also begin to ask you how to pronounce unfamiliar words which they notice around them. pay particular attention to the child at this stage and respond to their requests promptly. that way, you continue to build their literacy confidence., second grade phonics games: our phonics games in the second grade level, help children practice those sounds that tend to be a little trickier to teach. we offer activities to practice sounds such as r-controlled vowels – ir, ar, er, ur – which are not the most straightforward phonemic sounds to teach. then there are various sounds of y and double vowel sounds.  there is a reason these sounds are introduced later when children have developed confidence in reading words and sentences., word families phonics games for kindergarten: kindergarteners can practice a range of word families games from here. these activities mainly use short vowel and consonant combinations to develop word families. , word families phonics games for 1st grade: activities to practice word families for grade one learners can also be found here. these activities mainly review word families with and vowel digraphs.  , word families phonics games for 2nd grade : grade two phonics learners can also develop competence in reading by practicing with word families that use long vowel sounds and vowel digraphs., sentence games for phonics: looking for games to practice reading short sentences? then you are hereby covered., facebook,
