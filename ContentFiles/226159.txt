[what is the time complexity of following function fun()? assume that log(x) returns log value in base 2. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , time complexity of the above function can be written as θ(log 1) + θ(log 2) + θ(log 3) + . . . . + θ(log n) which is θ(log n!) order of growth of ‘log n!’ and ‘n log n’ is same for large values of n, i.e., θ(log n!) = θ(n log n). so time complexity of fun() is θ(n log n). the expression θ(log n!) = θ(n log n) can be easily derived from following stirling’s approximation (or stirling’s formula). , please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. sources:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stirling%27s_approximation, writing code in comment? please use
