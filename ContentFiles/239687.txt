connections, groups participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in section 1.3; information from advertising partners, vendors and publishers; and

or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a member). we will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). if you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the linkedin services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. for example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. ad choices we adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. this does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools.

a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the services (e.g., profile). however, if you view or click on an ad on or off our services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed ids or device identifiers received from us. in such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. 2.5 marketing we promote our services to you and others. in addition to advertising our services, we use members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting

your settings. profile your profile is fully visible to all members and customers of our services. subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our services (e.g., visitors to our services or users of third- party search engines). as detailed in our help center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. posts, likes, follows,

calculated in part based on their personal account activity. we understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our services). subject to your settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 communication archival regulated members may need to store communications outside of our service. some members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. we enable archiving of messages by and to those members outside of our services. for example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 others’ services you may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on

services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. 3.4 related services we share your data across our different services and linkedin affiliated entities. we will share
