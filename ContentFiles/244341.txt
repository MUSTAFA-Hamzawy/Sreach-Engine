[.&& wether is a prime example of a word that will slip past the spell check. it is easily confused with two of its homonyms.&& whether and weather. flying fingers find it easy to miss the single letter that separates them. unless you’re a farmer.&& you might not even know that wether is either a:.&& male sheep or ram (the oxford dictionary of etymology traces its roots to old english.&& old high german.&& old norse and goth).&& or a:.&& castrated ram or billy goat (according to a word a day)..&& we all know that ms word can be easily confused.&& but there’s no need for us to face the same confusion..&& weather.&& that stuff up there in the sky.&& is the ‘condition of the atmosphere with respect to heat or cold.&& calm or storm.&& etc’. that’s according to the oxford dictionary of etymology..&& interestingly.&& when it was first used in old english in the 12th century.&& weather always had adverse implications. in the 14th century.&& the term also referred to the wind direction.&& and its roots lie in various terms meaning either wind or storm..&& weathering.&& derived from weather.&& is the result of exposure to wind and weather..&& the frequently misspelled whether is used to introduce a question.&& often outlining a choice between options. its roots lie in old english and old high german..&& here’s my attempt at using them all in a sentence. the farmer wondered whether the adverse weather had affected his wether..&& while “weather” is usually a noun that applies to what’s happening outside your window – whether it’s sunny.&& raining.&& cloudy.&& and so on – the word “weather” can also be a verb..&& this usage is less common.&& and can sometimes come across as a little formal or old-fashioned.&& but you’re likely to come across it at least sometimes.&& so it’s well worth knowing about..&& here are some examples of “weather” as a verb:.&& example #1:.&& after so many years.&& it’s no surprise that the rocks are weathered..&& in this context.&& the verb “weathered” means that the rocks have been worn away or eroded by the action of the weather: the wind and rain.&& in particular..&& example #2:.&& our company has managed to weather the recession..&& in this sentence.&& “weather” means to “withstand” or “survive” something that’s difficult or dangerous..&& example #3:.&& the ship won’t weather the storm..&& used in the context of ships and storms.&& “weather” means to “come safely through”..&& the word “whether” can only be used as a conjunction. it can’t be a verb or noun..&& it’s used in situations where there are two options.&& though one option may be implied rather than stated..&& “whether” is quite often.&& but by no means always.&& followed with “or not”. in many cases.&& “or not” is implied..&& here are some examples:.&& i’ll go to the park whether or not it’s sunny..&& i’m trying to decide whether i’d like another glass..&& i wonder whether you heard me right?.&& i don’t know whether i should go to john’s leaving party or mary’s baby shower..&& i’d like you to apologize.&& whether or not you’re sorry..&& in many sentences.&& the word “whether” could be replaced with “if”.&& though this doesn’t work well if there’s an “or not” immediately after “whether”..&& these sentences work with an “if”:.&& i’m trying to decide if i’d like another glass..&& i wonder if you heard me right?.&& i don’t know if i should go to john’s leaving party or mary’s baby shower..&& these two just about work with “if” and the repositioning of “or not”.&& but sound a little awkward:.&& i’ll go to the park if it’s sunny or not..&& i’d like you to apologize.&& if you’re sorry or not..&& if you find “wether” in a written piece.&& it’s almost certainly a simple typo (unless you’re reading a farming magazine)..&& the words “weather” and “whether” are both in common use.&& though.&& and that’s why it’s easy for people to confuse them. as homonyms.&& they sound the same but have different spellings and meanings – and that can make them especially tricky to remember..&& another possible confusion is with the word “wither”.&& which is a verb that means “shrivel” or “decay” – as in “the fruit withered on the tree”..&& you may also find “whether” and “weather” getting muddled up with the word “whither” which is an archaic word meaning “to where” – as in.&& “whither are you bound?”.&& if you’re unsure which you want in your own writing.&& remember that “whether” is always used to introduce some kind of question (though there won’t necessarily be a question mark involved). like many other question words.&& it starts with a “wh” – compare with why.&& where.&& who.&& what.&& and when..&& .&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day?
