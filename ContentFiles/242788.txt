[amazon works hard to delight our customers every day.&& and we want you to have peace of mind when shopping for products in our store—including items sold by third-party sellers..&& amazon’s longstanding a-to-z guarantee protects you when you buy items that are sold and fulfilled by a third-party seller. it covers both the timely delivery and condition of your items. if youre not happy with either and can’t resolve the issue directly with the seller.&& you can make a claim directly to amazon for a refund..&& we are continually looking for new ways to innovate for you.&& and this year we expanded our a-to-z guarantee to include a process for resolving personal injury and property damage claims due to a defective product. amazon is the first and only company that we are aware of that offers this level of protection for customers when purchasing products from third-party sellers..&& through the expanded a-to-z guarantee.&& if you should ever have a valid personal injury or property damage claim resulting from a defective product sold by a third-party seller.&& you can contact amazon customer service to resolve the matter. while customers can file claims up to $1 million.&& more than 80% of claims are for less than $1.&&000. for claims under $1.&&000.&& amazon will resolve these cases on behalf of our selling partners who have insurance. if a selling partner does not have insurance or the claim is over $1.&&000.&& we will assist customers by notifying third-party sellers of valid claims.&& and ensuring that they or their insurance companies respond to and resolve the claim in a timely manner..&& sellers are responsible for ensuring the products they sell in our store are safe and compliant.&& for holding valid product liability insurance.&& and for addressing and paying valid customer claims. if the seller or their insurer denies a claim that amazon believes is valid.&& we will step in to address the customer’s claim. this approach helps ensure claims are addressed quickly and easily for customers.&& while protecting sellers from fraudulent.&& abusive.&& or frivolous claims..&& our expanded a-to-z guarantee helps you shop with confidence in
