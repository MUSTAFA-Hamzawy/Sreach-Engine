convolutional neural networks (cnns), multimodal interaction, on the limits of evaluating embodied agent model generalization using validation sets hyounghun kim, aishwarya padmakumar, di jin, mohit bansal, dilek hakkani-tür acl 2022 workshop on insights from negative results in nlp 2022 natural language guided embodied task completion is a challenging problem since it requires understanding natural language instructions, aligning them with egocentric visual observations, and choosing appropriate actions to execute in the environment to produce desired changes. we experiment with augmenting a transformer model for this task with modules that effectively utilize a wider field of view and computer vision, scvrl: shuffled contrastive video representation learning michael dorkenwald, fanyi xiao, biagio brattoli, joseph tighe, davide modolo cvpr 2022 workshop on learning with limited labelled data for image and video understanding 2022 we propose scvrl, a novel contrastive-based framework for self-supervised learning for videos. differently from previous contrast learning based methods that mostly focus on learning visual semantics (e.g., cvrl), scvrl is capable of learning both semantic and motion patterns. for that, we reformulate the popular shuffling pretext task within a modern contrastive learning paradigm. we show that our transformer-based computer vision, unstructured object matching using co-salient region segmentation ioana-sabina stoian, ionut-catalin sandu, daniel voinea, alin-ionut popa cvpr 2022 workshop on image matching: local features & beyond 2022 unstructured object matching is a less-explored and very challenging topic in the scientific literature. this includes matching scenarios where the context, appearance and the geometrical integrity of the objects to be matched changes drastically from one image to another (e.g. a pair of pyjamas which in one image is folded and in the other is worn by a person), making it impossible to determine a transformation computer vision, consent: context sensitive transformer for bold words classification ionut-catalin sandu, daniel voinea, alin-ionut popa cvpr 2022 2022 we present consent, a simple yet effective context sensitive transformer framework for context-dependent object classification within a fully-trainable end-to-end deep learning pipeline. we exemplify the proposed framework on the task of bold words detection proving state-of-the-art results. given an image containing text of unknown font-types (e.g. arial, calibri, helvetica), unknown language, taken under computer vision, diva: dataset derivative of a learning task yonatan dukler, alessandro achille, giovanni paolini, avinash ravichandran, marzia polito, stefano soatto iclr 2022 2022 we present a method to compute the derivative of a learning task with respect to a dataset. a learning task is a function from a training set to the validation error, which can be represented by a trained deep neural network (dnn). the “dataset derivative” is a linear operator, computed around the trained model, that informs how perturbations of the weight of each training sample affect the validation error
