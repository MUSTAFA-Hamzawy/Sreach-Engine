[reviews / kitchen.&& ↳ get the zojirushi 5.5-cup micom rice cooker from bed bath & beyond.&& or see more options on amazon.&& the running joke among my friends and family is my ability to somehow mess up white rice. every time i tried to cook a pot.&& it would come out gluey or undercooked.&& resulting in uneasy smiles from my dinner guests as they crunched through their meals. but i have high rice-pectations. growing up.&& my family always had a tiger cooker on a side table near the kitchen.&& churning out hot and fluffy rice at all hours of the day. .&& after seeing numerous reviews and tiktok videos touting the superiority of the zojirushi rice cooker.&& i was intrigued. but the thing that made me hit that “buy” button? a person in my facebook vietnamese cooking group asked for a rice cooker recommendation.&& and overwhelmingly.&& people waxed poetic about their ​​zojirushi rice cookers..&& when you’re shopping for a rice cooker.&& you’ll want to consider how often you might make rice at home. chances are.&& if you’re in the market for such an appliance.&& you are likely more than a casual consumer of rice. it’s also important to think about how you’ll use your rice cooker. are you someone.&& like my grandparents.&& who likes having a pot warming at all hours of the day? or do you need a timer.&& so that the rice will be ready when you come home from work? do you like a steaming function to do double-duty for proteins and steamed vegetables? .&& furthermore.&& your rice cooker should be built to last. i recommend models that can cook several different kinds of rice.&& such as brown rice.&& or even congee (a type of rice porridge). some people like the option of retractable cords.&& while others living in small spaces tend to consider kitchen counter real estate above all else. one of the most important purchase factors.&& in my opinion.&& is the material of the inner pot and how well it lasts through multiple cooking sessions. my family has used budget rice cookers in the past and found the coating of the inner pot can disintegrate quickly.&& or the parts would break after only a few months of use. .&& i opted for the zojirushi 5.5-cup micom rice cooker.&& a mid-range model that has the features i most cared about. aside from the clean white color (the stainless steel model runs you $30 more).&& the micom has settings for 11 types of rice (even a “mixed” setting.&& if you want to combine white and brown). it boasts a triple heater system that guarantees a consistent temperature while cooking and warming. there are also double sensors on the machine.&& so even if you measure improperly.&& the cooker can adjust to give you a perfect pot of rice every time. it has a simple digital display that allows you to time your rice with a warming capacity of up to 20(!) hours.&& and because zojirushi is a respected brand.&& you can rest easy knowing that you’re getting a product that’s been proven over the years..&& i was eager to start dinner the night my zojirushi arrived. i washed my rice (because.&& yes.&& you should!) a few times and measured out my cooking water. the zojirushi was simple to program and set.&& thanks in part to a soft-open lid function that made the whole process feel somehow more luxurious. the cooker is very quiet.&& unlike other rice cooker brands that burble with the vigor of a swamp thing emerging from the murk. within a few minutes.&& i smelled the steamy scent of cooking rice.&& and 50-something minutes later.&& the rice was done. for those who like cute features.&& the zojirushi also plays little tunes as it starts and stops.&& like “twinkle.&& twinkle.&& little star.” but the real test? the taste and texture of the rice. .&& it was a great pot of rice.&& let me tell you. the grains were distinct.&& but fluffy.&& with a light texture. they were the perfect canvas for the grilled fish and vegetables i served on the side. even my little one deigned to try some.&& balancing a bite of rice on her spoon before declaring it “pretty good.” after one serving.&& my husband and i sheepishly got up for another. i made a large pot and happily stored the leftover rice for the next night.&& where it would find new life as a spicy fried rice. .&& the best part was the cleanup. the zojirushi breaks down quickly.&& without any befuddling parts.&& and cleans like a dream (no leftover stickiness or soaking). the cleaning factor is especially critical for me.&& after i noticed a weird smell and mold in a previous rice cooker brand with parts that could not be removed. knowing that you can properly sanitize your rice cooker is immensely reassuring.&& since any appliance that involves water and starch usually carries a risk of some contamination. .&& prep and cleanup logistics aside.&& this appliance has been a game-changer in our kitchen. we tend to rely on some favorites when it comes to cookware.&& and the zojirushi micom rice cooker has soared to the top of the list. i can’t wait for my mother and grandparents to visit me this summer.&& where i’ll host them for a change. and in addition to all the hospitality i have to offer.&& a warm rice cooker sitting on the counter will be the greatest gift of home i can provide. .&& ][the rice cooker that gives me perfect, fluffy rice every time, buying a rice cooker, cleaning, zojirushi rice cooker, featured product, everlane canvas utility boot, more you might like, how to make the perfect cup of espresso, how you can save time with pressure cookers, garbage disposals that make kitchen clean-up easy, the best way to grind coffee, according to baristas, new & noteworthy, how to make the perfect cup of espresso, the best kids tablets, according to technophiles, the best houseplants for plant killers, benefits of weighted blankets, according to occupational therapists]zojirushi micom rice cooker | reviews by britannica[every product is independently curated by our reviews team.][]
