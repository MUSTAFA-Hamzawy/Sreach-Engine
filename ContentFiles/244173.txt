let your child watch. ask the child simple questions for example:.&& 1- who are in the story? 2- which sounds do you often hear? 3- can you tell the story in your own words? next.&& turn on the audio and let the child hear it being read. finally turn off audio again and then pause when words show up. ask the child to attempt to read the sentences. can he/she do it? yeah! go out and celebrate -
