[watching a single episode of the evening news can be informative. tracking trends in broadcasts over time can be fascinating. .&& the internet archive has preserved nearly 3 million hours of u.s. local and national tv news shows and made the material open to researchers for exploration and non-consumptive computational analysis. at a webinar april 13.&& tv news archive experts shared how they’ve curated the massive collection and leveraged technology so scholars.&& journalists and the general public can make use of the vast repository..&& roger macdonald.&& founder of the tv news archive.&& and kalev leetaru.&& collaborating data scientist and gdelt project founder.&& spoke at the session. chris freeland.&& director of open libraries.&& served as moderator and internet archive founder brewster kahle offered opening remarks..&& “growing up in the television age.&& [television] is such an influential.&& important medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote.&&” kahle said. “we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.” .&& the internet archive built on the work of the vanderbilt television archive.&& and the ucla library broadcast newsscape to give the public a broader “macro view.&&” said kahle. the trends seen in at-scale computational analyses of news broadcasts can be used to understand the bigger picture of what is happening in the world and the lenses through which we see the world around us..&& in 2012.&& with donations from individuals and philanthropies such as the knight foundation.&& the archive started repurposing the closed captioning data stream required of all u.s. broadcasters into a search index. “this simple approach transformed the antiquated experience of searching for specific topics within video.&&” said macdonald.&& who helped lead the effort. “the tv caption search enabled discovery at internet speed with the ability to simultaneously search millions of programs and have your results plotted over time.&& down to individual broadcasters and programs.”.&& “[television] is such an influential.&& important medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote. we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.”.&& scholars and journalists were quick to embrace this opportunity.&& but the team kept experimenting with deeper indexing. techniques like audio fingerprinting.&& optical character recognition (ocr) and computer vision made it possible to capture visual elements of the news and improve access.&& macdonald said. .&& sub-collections of political leaders’ speeches and interviews have been created.&& including an extensive donald trump archive. some of the archive’s most productive advances have come from collaborating with outsiders who have requested more access to the collection than is available through the public interface.&& macdonald said. with appropriate restrictions to maintain respect for broadcasters and distribution platforms.&& the archive has worked with select scientists and journalists as partners to use data in the collection for more complex analyses..&& treating television news as data creates vast opportunities for computational analysis.&& said leetaru. researchers can track word frequency use in the news and how that has changed over time.  for instance.&& it’s possible to look at mentions of covid-related words across selected news programs and see when it surged and leveled off with each wave before plummeting downward.&& as shown in the graph below..&& the newly computed metadata can help provide context and assist with fact checking efforts to combat misinformation. it can allow researchers to map the geography of television news—how certain parts of the world are covered more than others.&& leetaru said. through the collections.&& researchers have explored  which presidential tweets challenging election integrity got the most exposure on the news.  ocr of every frame has been used to create models of how to identify names of every “dr.” depicted on cable tv after the outbreak of covid-19 and calculate air time devoted to the medical doctors commenting on one of the virus variants.  reverse image lookup of images in tv news has been used to determine the source of photos and videos.  visual entity search tools can even reveal the increasing prevalence of bookshelves as backdrops during home interviews in the pandemic.&& as well as appearances of books by specific authors or titles. open datasets of computed tv news metadata are available that include all visual entity and ocr detections.&& 10-minute interval captioning ngrams and second by second inventories of each broadcast cataloging whether it was “news” programming.&& “advertising” programming or “uncaptioned” (in the case of television news this is almost exclusively advertising)..&& from television news to digitized books and periodicals.&& dozens of projects rely on the collections available at archive.org for computational and bibliographic research across a large digital corpus. data scientists or anyone with questions about the tv news archives.&& can contact info@archive.org..&& this webinar was the fourth a series of six sessions highlighting how researchers in the humanities use the internet archive. the next will be about analyzing biodiversity literature at scale on april 27. register here..&& a round up on what’s happening at the tv news archive by katie dahl and nancy watzman..&& this week we release new data generated by our face-o-matic tool.&& developed in collaboration with matroid.&& adding to our list of public figures detected by facial-recognition on major cable news stations on the  tv news archive..&& in addition to president donald trump and the four congressional leaders.&& the expanded list now includes most former living presidents and recent major party presidential contenders.&& including hillary clinton and barack obama. (for the full list of public officials tracked.&& as well as methodical notes.&& see bottom of the post.).&& detecting faces on tv news and turning them into data provides a new quantitative path for journalists and researchers to explore how news is presented to the public and compare and contrast editorial choices that individual networks make. this new measure shows us the duration that politicians’ faces are actually shown on screen.&& whether it’s a clip of that person speaking.&& muted footage.&& or a still photo shown in the background to illustrate a point..&& adding to the television explorer.&& fueled by closed captions and our third eye chyron reading tool.&& a wealth of information is now available to analyze. (see the tv news archive home page for examples of visualizations created by journalists and researchers using tv news archive data.).&& here are six quick takeaways using face-o-matic for an analysis covering roughly six months.&& from november 2017 through may 2018.&& looking at four cable tv news networks: bbc news.&& cnn.&& fox news.&& and msnbc..&& download face-o-matic data to explore your own research questions. 1. trump trumps every other political figure in face-time on cable tv news.&& all the time.&& every day.&& in every way.&& on every network and program..&& as we’ve seen in past analyses with face-o-matic data.&& president donald trump is the major political star on cable tv news as compared to other top political figures examined. to put this in perspective: over a six month period stretching from november 2017 to may 2018.&& the president’s face appeared on tv cable news the equivalent of a full 13.5 days.&& counting every second of face-time. the next closest political figure we analyzed was house speaker paul ryan.&& r..&& wis..&& whose visage appeared the equivalent of one day..&& .&& the two gop leaders in congress.&& ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell.&& r..&& ky. are the next most popular faces on tv news cable news networks. between the two.&& ryan ranks first on the tv news cable networks we examined: bbc news.&& cnn.&& fox news.&& and msnbc.  mcconnell is the next most shown face on these networks.&& with the exception of bbc news..&& .&& link to interactive version of above chart.&& where view can be changed to exclude specific politicians..&& fox news airs proportionately more images of failed presidential candidate 2016 hillary clinton and former president barack obama than other cable tv news networks. fox news showed clinton’s face 7.6 times more than cnn did.&& and obama’s 3.6 times more. fox news also showed clinton 3.6 times more than msnbc.&& and obama.&& 2.3 times more..&& .&& not only does the fox news “hannity” program air more images of hillary clinton proportionately than any other top rated fox news show.&& with just one exception.&& it is the fox news show that shows her face more than current congressional leaders–ryan.&& mcconnell.&& schumer or pelosi. “hannity” also shows more images of obama than other top rated fox news shows..&& .&& link to interactive version of above chart.&& where view can be changed to exclude specific politicians..&& all three u.s. cable news networks examined showed high rates of face-time for ryan on shows airing during morning hours.&& ranging from 9 am to 11 am. this may be linked to his leadership role in congress and that morning hours are prime for large announcements. for example.&& on fox news’ “america’s newsroom” and “happening now” show spikes of face-time for ryan. on msnbc.&& “live with hallie jackson” and “live with velshi and ruhle” show high rates of images for ryan. and on cnn.&& “at this hour with kate bolduan” shows high rates of ryan as well. .&& .&& links to interactive charts for top-rated news shows; view can be adjusted to exclude specific politicians. the source for top-rated shows is shows with 2017 top viewership by nielsen..&& top-rated fox news shows..&& top-rated msnbc news shows..&& top-rated cnn shows..&& bbc news provides a window into how news is presented to a major foreign audience. like u.s. cable news networks.&& bbc news features more face-time for trump than other political figures examined. ryan ranks a distant second. overall.&& bbc news.&& however.&& shows much lower rates of images of u.s. political figures than u.s. cable news shows do..&& .&& link to interactive version of above chart.&& where view can be changed to exclude specific politicians. methodological notes.&& the face-o-matic data set.&& available for download on the internet archive.&& uses facial recognition to track the faces of prominent public officials as they appear on major cable tv news networks: bbc news.&& cnn.&& fox news.&& and msnbc. the list of public officials tracked.&& along with the date that detection began.&& is here:.&& president & current congressional leaders.&& president donald trump.&& 7/13/17.&& speaker paul ryan.&& r..&& wis..&& 7/13/17.&& house minority leader nancy pelosi.&& d..&& calif..&& 7/13/17.&& senate majority leader mitch mcconnell.&& r..&& ky..&& 7/13/17.&& senate minority leader.&& chuck schumer.&& d..&& n.y..&& 7/13/17.&& former living presidents and recent major party presidential candidates*.&& george h.w. bush.&& 10/5/17.&& george w. bush.&& 11/1/17.&& jimmy carter.&& 10/21/17.&& bill clinton.&& 9/12/17.&& hillary clinton.&& 9/12/17.&& barack obama.&& 7/13/17.&& mitt romney.&& 10/4/17.&& *note: our data set does not include sen. john mccain.&& r..&& ariz..&& who ran for president opposite obama in 2008. sample testing of facial detection for the senator revealed a somewhat frequent rate of false positives  – instances where the identified face was not the senator’s.&& but rather one of a number of lookalikes. while we make no claim that all of the detections in the face-o-matic data set are error free.&& we did test faces to minimize these. please be sure to notify us if you find errors in the data..&& a round up on what’s happening at the tv news archive by katie dahl and nancy watzman..&& this week we explore cutting edge work by joostware that moves us closer to solving the challenge of searching vast archives of video by speaker.&& note the use of tv news archive data by the new york times and axios.&& and share a fact-checked interview by exiting house speaker paul ryan about his legacy..&& what if you wanted to search the tv news archive to find every instance where president donald trump is talking?.&& that’s the research question that the san francisco-based firm joostware concentrated on for its who said what project.&& which won a $50.&&000 prototype grant from the john s. and james l. knight foundation. last week joostware’s founder.&& delip rao.&& presented the project’s progress at a gathering in austin.&& texas. (the internet archive’s own dan schultz.&& in his bad idea factory incarnation.&& also presented on contextubot.&& which we recently profiled here.).&& “audio and video today is viewed as an opaque object and it’s meant for linear consumption.&&” rao said in his presentation. “but truly any audio and video especially in the context of news has a lot of structure to it. there are speakers of interest.&& and these speakers take turns.&& and then within each turn something was communicated. so our goal is to identify these speakers who are of interest and also the content that was spoken in that turn and indexing that.”.&& anyone can search the tv news archive already via closed captions at the internet archive or via television explorer. our experiments with facial detection and chyron extraction are another way to find and analyze news clips. but searching a video archive by “speaker id” – finding all the video where a person is actually talking – is a tough technical challenge. our trump archive and congressional.&& executive branch.&& and administration archives are all manually curated video collections designed to demonstrate what it would be like to have automated speaker id search..&& joostware researchers have made progress toward this goal. they took material from the trump archive.&& and used it to train a model that recognizes the president’s voice.&& by using properties of the voice signal. they created a prototype search software that is more than 95% accurate on a human annotated dataset in returning video clips where trump is actually speaking..&& what’s next? with more resources.&& joostware hopes to give this technology back to the internet archive to improve search within the tv news archive. and rao and others continue to work within the larger community of researchers working to crack the code of video to help fact-checkers and journalists hold power accountable..&& .&& jim tankersley and karl russell.&& reporters for the new york times.&& used tv news archive captions via gdelt’s television explorer to demonstrate how little coverage there is on cable tv news for the newly minted $2.5 trillion tax overhaul:.&& “consider one of mr. trump’s preferred yardsticks: cable news coverage. throughout the fall.&& as republicans rushed their tax bill through congress in two breakneck months.&& cnn.&& fox news and msnbc routinely devoted 10 percent of their daily coverage to tax issues.&& according to data from the gdelt project. interest spiked as mr. trump signed the bill in late december.&& and then it fell precipitously.”.&& .&& for axios.&& caitlin owens used tv new archive data with gdelt’s television explorer to shed light on whether the tv networks are paying attention the priorities of the political parties: “tax cuts and the affordable care act are supposed to be big issues in the midterm elections.&& but both have faded from the attention of the cable news networks now that they’re no longer front and center in congress.” owens thinks it matters because “democrats are campaigning hard on the gop’s unpopular attempt to repeal and replace the aca.&& and republicans are pushing the financial benefits of their tax law.”.&& .&& house speaker paul ryan.&& r..&& wisc..&& announced last week he would not be seeking reelection.&& prompting television interviews that reflected on his legacy. in a “meet the press” interview sunday on nbc.&& host chuck todd asked ryan to respond to a statement by sen. bob corker.&& r..&& tenn.:.&& “’this congress and this administration likely will go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations and congresses that we ever had.’ and he’s referring to the fact that this tax bill spiked the deficit. it’s higher than even what was projected.” ryan responded “that was going to happen. the baby boomers’ retiring was going to do that. these deficit trillion-dollar projections have been out there for a long.&& long time. why? because of mandatory spending.&& which we call entitlements. discretionary spending under the cbo baseline is going up about $300 billion over the next 10 years. tax revenues are still rising. income tax revenues are still rising. corporate income tax revenues. corporate rate got dropped 40 percent.&& still rising.”.&& eugene kiely reported for factcheck.org that “ryan is right that $1 trillion deficit projections ‘have been out there for a long.&& long time…but corporate tax revenues are down for the first six months of the fiscal year.&& and they are projected to be less over the next 10 years than they otherwise would have been because of the law.”.&& salvador rizzo and meg kelly reported for the washington post’s fact checker.&& “the baby-boom generation is retiring.&& and congress at best has taken only modest steps to rein in spending on old-age programs.&& largely because any serious effort is met with hostility and often-misleading attack ads…but the revenue side of the

border. there are court cases and laws that require some unaccompanied children, families and asylum-seekers to be released in the u.s., pending an immigration hearing. but it’s a stretch to blame those entirely on democrats., trump said “big flows of people” are illegally entering the u.s. from mexico “to take advantage of daca.” in fact, current border-crossers are not eligible for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program., trump said that “caravans” of people were coming to the southwest border and that mexico “must stop them.” the caravan, a yearly demonstration, was organized by the activist group pueblo sin fronteras, which says the people walking in the caravan have “a lot of intentions,” with some wanting to stay in mexico. the caravan is now in southern

responsible federal budget] said the tax cut in 1981 under president ronald reagan, at 2.9 percent of gdp, is the largest in history.”, wapo: “trump’s tax cut is only the eighth-largest — and is even smaller than two of barack obama’s tax cuts.”, wapo: “what kennedy leaves out is that the epi study is updated annually, and in the most recent version, covering 2016, the ratio between ceo and worker pay at the top 350 companies had declined somewhat, to 271 to 1. in making his point, kennedy accurately refers only to the ‘top ceos.’ but it’s important to note that he is presenting an outdated snapshot of only one year (2013) and that the epi study is not the only research on this subject. similar data from the wall street journal and bloomberg show that the ratio between what top ceos and their workers make is closer to 200 to 1.”, politifact: “his numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. the afl-cio put the ratio at 347-to-1. the liberal economic policy institute said ceos make either 271 or 224 times that of average employees, depending on how you measure stock options. bloomberg pegged the ratio at 265-to-1.” politifact rated the
