[, data structure and algorithms course practice problems on queue recent articles on queue, a queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. the order is first in first out (fifo). a good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. the difference between stacks and queues is in removing. in a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added., , topics :, introduction :, implementation :, standard problems :,
