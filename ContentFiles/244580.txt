qi studies do not require irb review and research studies do. this determination is formally made through the pme education scholarship study review. it cannot be made by the study proposal writer. .&& the harvard longwood campus (hlc) institutional review board (irb) has put together an irb decision tool to assist investigators in determining if their activities are research.&& if their research involves human subjects.&& and/or if they need to submit an irb application. this decision tool should only be used by investigators who will act on behalf of a hlc school (hsph.&& hms.&& or hsdm) while conducting research activities. harvardkey log in is required to use the tool. the irb decision tool can be found here: decision tool.&& in most cases.&& the pme review can discern whether a study falls into the qi or research category. if the pme review is unsure whether or not a study falls into the category of research.&& the hms irb will provide guidance on this question. an hhs decision chart outlines the details of determining whether a project would be considered human subjects research..&& qi studies.&& perhaps more familiar to clinicians in patient safety and quality approaches such as plan-do-study-act (pdsa).&& also apply to the continuous quality improvement of medical courses.&& clerkships.&& and curricula. work that aims to assess and improve a specific course.&& program.&& or rotation is likely to fall into this category. theoretical models may be employed to inform the study.&& but these are not always needed.&& and more exploratory.&& hypothesis-generating approaches are often prevalent. studies with a qi approach can be published.&& but investigators should provide journals with a qi exemption letter from the pme education scholarship review validating that the study was determined to be “not human subjects research.” although human subjects.&& such as students.&& may be actively participating in the study.&& the study would not be considered “research.”.&& while it is always advisable to check with a specific journal editor or review articles in your targeted journal to ensure that they publish qi studies.&& in general.&& studies that have a “not human subjects research” determination can be published. in place of the usual description of irb approval.&& you can simply provide journals with a qi exemption letter from the pme education scholarship review committee validating that the study was determined to be “not human subjects research.”.&& the us department of health and human services office for human research protections (ohrp) provides guidelines and regulations for research involving interaction with and/or data related to human subjects—in this case.&& medical students. the ohrp definition of research is as follows: “research means a systematic investigation.&& including research development.&& testing.&& and evaluation.&& designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” “generalizable knowledge” is a key consideration in determining whether or not a study is considered research; that is.&& can the results be generalized to a larger population (of schools or students).&& or do the results primarily pertain to hms? studies that are designed to test theories or build knowledge in the field are likely to be considered research. examples would include research on motivation.&& depression and burnout.&& or cognitive load..&& for more information see.&& refer to a description of criteria for each of these categories..&& the proposal writer should start by reviewing the guidelines and submission information in the before you apply section. the principal investigator submits a data access request to the pme education scholarship review committee. when the complete application has been submitted.&& the pi will receive a confirmation receipt by email..&& the request will be screened for alignment with hms curricular priorities.&& scientific merit and survey burden. studies that address potentially sensitive topics will also require review and approval by the dean for medical education. if the request is approved.&& you will be invited to complete the online submission form to request an irb qi exemption. if the request is not approved.&& you will receive a letter explaining why your data access and/or survey request has been denied.&& indicating a revise & resubmit or a rejection..&& the pme educational scholarship review committee will review the online submission form. the outcome of the review will be sent to the principal investigator. there are many requests to conduct research studies with students as participants.&& so unfortunately not all proposals can be approved. applicants who receive conditional approval may choose to revise and resubmit their application. feedback on resubmissions will be provided to investigators..&& approved studies will also be designated as either research or quality improvement. if the committee deems your study to be qi.&& the study is irb-exempt. the committee will send a letter granting irb exemption. this letter can be submitted to journals with your manuscript in lieu of an irb approval..&& if the committee requires input from the irb because it is a research study.&& they will refer you to the longwood campus. research studies require hms irb review. the pme will send a copy of the pme education scholarship study review approval notice to the hms irb for all pme-approved research studies..&& it is recommended that pi’s share their study
