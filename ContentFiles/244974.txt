[.&& what’s wrong with these sentences? they each have syntax that creates an obstacle to clear understanding of the relationships of words or phrases to others. revise them.&& and then scroll down to see my annotated solutions..&& 1. “people do not go outside their homes after dark.&& saying they fear muggers and police looking for bribes.”.&& 2. “marc antony was not to be depicted as a monster.&& but as a love-struck fool.”.&& 3. “people no longer seem to care about owning movies.&& are decreasingly interested in going to the movie theater.&& and studios seem to be betting on the fact that the format.&& not the actual movie.&& is the selling point.”.&& 4. “the company apparently wastes very little money on lobbying and political contributions—nor.&& obviously.&& on a public relations department.”.&& 5. “he founded and ran the trade journal from 1987 to 1991.”.&& 1. “people do not go outside their homes after dark.&& saying they fear muggers — and police looking for bribes.”.&& explanation: the original sentence construction implies that residents fear being shaken down for bribes by muggers and police. a confusing sentence structure is sometimes clarified by reversing the order of the listed items.&& but “they fear police looking for bribes and muggers” only replicates the problem; now.&& the concern is identified as police on the lookout for both extortion opportunities and hoodlums. however.&& giving the police objectives equal weight muddles the sentence’s meaning. introducing parallelism inspired by the previous phrase — “they fear both muggers and police looking for bribes” — is better but still somewhat awkward..&& a superior solution is to use the correlative conjunction “not only” and its companion phrase “but also.&&” which not only provides logical syntax but also strengthens the sentence’s impact by introducing the mundane followed by the unexpected: “people do not go outside their homes after dark.&& saying they fear not only muggers but also police looking for bribes.” however.&& the original solution offered above does so most simply..&& 2. “marc antony was to be depicted not as a monster but as a love-struck fool.”.&& explanation: this syntax resembles the correct form of the “not only . . . but also” construction alluded to above. however.&& the phrase “was not to be depicted as a monster” works only if it is juxtaposed with an independent clause: “marc antony was not to be depicted as a monster; the intent was to portray him as a love-struck fool.”.&& otherwise.&& the solution is to poise not directly after the verb (depicted).&& rather than before it.&& so that the alternatives are represented in parallel.&& one preceded by “not as” and the other following as. (the as before “a monster.&&” sundered from not.&& does not logically convey the opposing idea of the as before “a love-struck fool.”).&& 3. “people no longer seem to care about owning movies and are decreasingly interested in going to the movie theater.&& and studios seem to be betting on the fact that the format.&& not the actual movie.&& is the selling point.”.&& explanation: this sentence expresses three ideas: movie ownership.&& interest in viewing movies in theaters.&& and studio perception that format is more important than product. but structurally.&& it implies that all three ideas will pertain to what consumers want. the presence of the third.&& studio-centric idea.&& however.&& means that the subject “people” pertains only to the first two ideas.&& which need to be linked with a conjunction.&& not a comma. (the studio idea is expressed in an independent clause.) therefore.&& this is not an “a.&& b.&& and c” sentence.&& but an “a and b.&& and c” sentence..&& 4. “the company apparently wastes very little money on lobbying and political contributions. (it also.&& obviously.&& spends nothing on a pr department.)”.&& explanation: nor is associated only with negative expressions: “neither you nor i is responsible”; “i didn’t get to see the movie.&& nor did i want to.” this sentence.&& though it refers to a company policy of minimalization of funding for certain activities.&& does not include a negative expression.&& so nor is incorrect..&& for it to be appropriate.&& the entire sentence would need to be cast in a negative sense.&& as in “the company apparently doesn’t spend very much money on lobbying and political contributions—nor.&& obviously.&& on a public relations department.” but perhaps the clearest revision is one that divides into separate sentences the comment about contributions from the one about public relations..&& 5. “he founded the trade journal in 1987 and ran it from its launch to 1991.”.&& explanation: the sentence structure implies that the consultant founded the trade journal during the given span of years as well as running it during that time.&& but founding occurs at a point.&& not along a time continuum.&& so the two actions — founding and running — need to be separated into distinct syntactical elements..&& but if you are editing this sentence.&& rather than writing it.&& and don’t know the facts firsthand.&& you need to confirm the founding date; the founder didn’t necessarily run the journal from the beginning.
