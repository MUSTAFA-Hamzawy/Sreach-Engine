been exposed to our clients’ content..&& responses are voluntary.&& and the surveys do not ask for or collect any directly identifiable data..&& we process personal data to provide our digital measurement services.&& which measure and analyze how consumers engage with media across online.&& mobile and emerging technologies. this enables the creation of research insights.&& reports.&& and analyses of consumer behaviors.&& including the composition of the audience that viewed certain content or about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.&& such as an audience measurement report finding that an ad campaign was viewed by “70.&&000 females between the ages 24-30 in the u.s..&& pacific northwest region.”.&& we use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying users from the reports and insights we create and provide to our clients. the data we collect from users is combined with the data collected from other sources to produce aggregated reports from which users cannot be uniquely identified; if it is not aggregated.&& we take steps to make sure there is no reasonable possibility of re-identification..&& in addition to
