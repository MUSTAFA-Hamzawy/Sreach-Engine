[from sequoias to cherry blossoms.&& the national geographic archives record a long love affair with trees..&& every tree tells a story. it may be a memorial to sorrow.&& an expression of belief.&& or a signpost of history. most of all.&& these narratives speak to how trees nourish the earth and us. it is no stretch to say that trees exhale so that we might inhale.&& but they enrich us in other.&& more spiritual.&& ways. buddha.&& after all.&& found enlightenment under a bodhi tree in nepal.&& an event echoed by john muir’s observation that “the clearest way into the universe is through a forest wilderness.”.&& as our photographic archives reveal.&& for more than a century.&& national geographic has used the power of the image to champion and spotlight trees.&& especially irreplaceable giants like the redwoods and sequoias that form the centerpiece of national and state parks in the western united states. in 1921.&& the national geographic society donated $100.&&000 to save what would become the giant forest of california’s sequoia national park.&& then imperiled by logging. the effort was spearheaded by the magazine’s first full-time editor.&& gilbert h. grosvenor. in his office he kept a photograph he took of 20 men linking their arms around the mammoth trunk of the 2.&&200-year-old sequoia known as general sherman. “it’s like they were protecting it.&&” he said..&& grosvenor’s son and successor as editor.&& melville bell grosvenor.&& would do the same for redwoods. he dispatched the society’s senior scientist to a california forest to find the “world’s tallest tree”—a 367-foot-tall redwood. grosvenor had the stupendous tree’s portrait made with a tiny figure (which just happened to be himself) standing beneath it. the image appeared on the cover of the july 1964 issue.&& and the society donated $64.&&000 toward a study that helped establish redwoods national park in 1968..&& the magazine would faithfully return to these trees.&& most notably in december 2009.&& when it published the image of a 300-foot-tall redwood in a california state park. photographer michael “nick” nichols and his crew rigged a nearby tree and incrementally lowered three remote-controlled cameras to shoot 84 top-to-bottom images of the mammoth redwood; the photos were then digitally stitched together. the six-page foldout that resulted.&& ken geiger.&& the picture editor on the story said at the time.&& “was an impossible view—the photographic equivalent of reaching mars. you couldn’t see the tree that clearly even if you rented a helicopter.”.&& nichols pulled off a similar feat for the december 2012 cover.&& which featured a 247-foot-high sequoia crowned with snow in sequoia national park..&& other less lofty.&& but no less memorable.&& trees have starred in the magazine pages or reside in its image archives. some of the photos’ stories are poignant.&& such as the catalpa trees outside a civil war hospital in virginia.&& where walt whitman witnessed amputated arms and legs tossed out of a window.&& or the callery pear “survivor tree” left standing after the 9/11 attack on the world trade center..&& some are inspirational: the apple tree in a grove at sir isaac newton’s childhood home in woolsthorpe.&& england.&& that reportedly inspired his eureka moment about the laws of gravity.&& and the whimsical tree with serpentine branches at christ church college.&& oxford.&& that was the inspiration for the favorite perch of the cheshire cat in lewis carroll’s alice’s adventures in wonderland..&& and then there are the celebratory images. in 1885.&& eliza ruhamah scidmore.&& the society’s first female writer.&& photographer.&& and board member.&& visited japan and was enchanted by the flowering cherry trees that bordered the tokyo’s sumida river. after returning home.&& she petitioned officials in washington.&& d.c..&& to plant trees like them. first lady helen taft used her clout to get the idea off the ground—or.&& rather.&& firmly planted in it. the first of the trees (among 3.&&000 donated by the japanese government) were placed around the tidal basin on march 27.&& 1912.&& and are today the spring glory of the annual national cherry blossom festival..&& yet.&& the shadow of ephemerality persists. nothing.&& not even a millennial-old tree.&& is guaranteed forever status. in 1990.&& photographer sam abell photographed a boab tree that.&& in the austere landscape of western australia.&& had turned white with age. when the magazine published the photo.&& abell’s guide returned to the spot to re-photograph it with the page bearing the image held up in the foreground. by then only a skeletal trunk remained. after more than 900 years.&& the boab had been struck by lightning..&& .&& .&& cathy
