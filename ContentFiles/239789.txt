[image from the gif collider.&& by greg niemeyer and olya dubatova.&& by greg niemeyer.&& director.&& berkeley center for new media.&& have you ever wondered what happened to all the gif animations that sparkled in the dawn of the internet? according to artists greg niemeyer and olya dubatova.&& they have become part of the digital subconscious.&& and the berkeley art museum & pacific film archive (bampfa) is presenting what that subconscious might look like.&& in an exhibit called gif collider..&& niemeyer studied both the internet archive’s  collections of gif animations and the prelinger film archives from the 1950’s. he noticed how the film archives.&& which include ads.&& educational films and propaganda.&& show a heavy gender and racial bias. in comparison.&& the gif animations from forty years later reflect less gender and racial bias—but we can’t help but wonder with more historical distance.&& what kinds of bias will become apparent in the future?  what about these gifs do we not see now.&& that will be obvious in 50 years?.&& for three days.&& from wednesday.&& october 26 to friday.&& october 28.&& from dawn to dusk.&& bampfa invites you to ponder these questions as thousands of gif animations emerge and collide on the huge public outdoor screen in a ballet of memory and erasure. call it an outstallation.&& and it’s free for the walking to the intersection of addison avenue and oxford avenue in berkeley. the gifs will be presented in several chapters.&& playing for 30 minutes of every hour..&& a special showcase with music made for the gif collider by paz lenchantin (pixies) and with live music performances by trevor bajus and space town is planned for friday.&& oct 28.&& from 6-8 pm..&& for more information:   http://www.bampfa.org/program/gif-collider-10][internet archive blogs, a blog from the team at archive.org, showcase: the gif collider at berkeley art museum, post navigation, recent posts, recent comments, categories, archives, meta]showcase: the gif collider at berkeley art museum - internet archive blogs[greg niemeyer, olya dubatova, berkeley art museum & pacific film archive, gif collider, prelinger film archives, wednesday, october 26 to friday, october 28, intersection of addison avenue and oxford avenue in berkeley., special showcase, paz lenchantin (pixies), trevor bajus and space town, friday, oct 28, from 6-8 pm., for more information:   , http://www.bampfa.org/program/gif-collider-10][blog, announcements, 25th anniversary, archive.org, about, events, developers, donate, preserving pro-democracy books from shuttered hong kong bookstore, memorial day bbq, live music and lost landscapes at the internet archive – monday may 30, 2022, goodbye facebook. hello decentralized social media?, fireside chat: congressman ro khanna in conversation with larry lessig, new additions to the internet archive for april 2022, antti on new additions to the internet archive for april 2022, موزیک من on new additions to the internet archive for april 2022, jerry on new additions to the internet archive for april 2022, ellie kesselman on fireside chat: congressman ro khanna in conversation with larry lessig, nemo on new additions to the internet archive for april 2022, 78rpm, announcements, archive version 2, archive-it, audio archive, books archive, cool items, education archive, emulation, event, image archive, jobs, lending books, live music archive, movie archive, music, news, newsletter, open library, past event, software archive, technical, television archive, upcoming event, video archive, wayback machine – web archive, web & data services, log in, entries feed, comments feed, wordpress.org]
