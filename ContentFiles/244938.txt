[the director of the centers for disease control and prevention and other federal officials spoke at the first white house briefing devoted to the pandemic in six weeks..&& by sharon lafraniere and sheryl gay stolberg.&& federal health officials on wednesday warned that one third of americans live in areas where the threat of infection from the coronavirus is now so high that they should consider wearing a mask in indoor public settings.&& whether local leaders require it or not..&& dr. rochelle p. walensky.&& the director of the centers for disease control and prevention.&& said that federal data showed the u.s. seven-day average of hospital admissions from covid-19 rose about 20 percent over the previous week. about 3.&&000 people a day were now being admitted with covid.&& she said.&& although death rates.&& a lagging indicator.&& remain low..&& for areas with high levels of community transmission.&& mostly in the northeast.&& “we urge local leaders to encourage the use of prevention strategies like masking in public indoor settings and increasing access to testing and treatment for individuals.&&” she said. people in areas with medium levels of transmission.&& including counties in nearly every state.&& should consider wearing a mask in indoor public settings.&& avoiding crowds and testing themselves.&& especially before gathering with others indoors.&& she said..&& dr. walensky and other federal officials spoke at the first white house briefing devoted solely to the pandemic in six weeks. they gave no explanation for the hiatus.&& but said that they had granted dozens of media interviews in the interim..&& dr. jha called the current increase in infections “very substantial” and warned that if congress fails to grant the administration’s request for $22 billion in new covid funding.&& the government will not have enough vaccines and treatments to combat a renewed surge of the virus expected this fall. the administration has said it wants to launch a booster campaign this fall.&& hopefully with vaccines retooled to work better against the latest version of the virus..&& while projections from biostatisticians vary greatly.&& he said that a scenario in which the nation had to face the virus without enough doses of vaccines and treatments would be “terrible.” if congress fails to provide critical funding.&& he said “i think it we would see a lot of unnecessary loss of life.”.&& officials also said that far too many americans are failing to take advantage of booster shots to bolster waning protection against infection.&& leaving themselves vulnerable to ever more contagious versions of the coronavirus. dr. walensky said 62 percent of those aged 50 to 64 have not received a booster in the past six months.&& nor have 57 percent of those 65 or older..&& dr. jha said the incidence of severe disease would be worse but for paxlovid.&& an oral treatment developed by pfizer that helps prevent severe illness if taken early enough after symptoms develop. doctors are now prescribing the paxlovid pills to about 20.&&000 patients a day.&& he said. that.&& he added.&& may explain why the rates of hospitalization and intensive care treatment are lower than expected given the jump in infections..&& “paxlovid is making a very big difference.&&” dr. jha said..&& in an implicit recognition that the pandemic is not over.&& the administration on monday quietly let pass a deadline for lifting the public health emergency.&& which has allowed the government to take steps like offering americans free coronavirus vaccines.&& tests and treatments; barring states from canceling people’s medicaid coverage; and expanding access to telehealth appointments. it has also allowed hospitals to get paid more for treating medicare patients who have covid..&& public health experts and hospital officials praised the extension of the emergency.&& which had been set to expire on july 15..&& “we’re seeing rising cases and hospitalizations and testing positivity rates; now is not the time to end these flexibilities that allow great access to care.&&” said ashley thompson.&& senior vice president for policy development at the american hospital association. “we are not out of the woods yet.”.&& as of tuesday.&& the average of new.&& confirmed coronavirus cases in the united states surpassed 100.&&000 a day for the first time since feb. 20.&& according to a new york times database. that figure is up 61 percent from two weeks ago. public health experts believe the true number is far higher.&& because many people are not reporting the results of at-home tests..&& this chart shows how three key metrics compare to the corresponding peak per capita level reached nationwide in january 2021..&& the big unanswered question.&& experts say.&& is whether the rise in cases that is already well underway will ultimately be followed by a commensurate rise in hospitalizations and deaths..&& “we could be entering a period where we have an increased number of cases but a substantially decreased severity of illness.&& so that we see fewer hospitalizations and many fewer deaths.&&” said michael t. osterholm.&& director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota. “but as absolutely uncomfortable and unsatisfactory as this is.&& we just don’t know what this virus is going to throw at us in the next 90 days.”.&& that poses a messaging challenge for the white house.&& he said: “what we need to do is not whipsaw from.&& ‘we’re over.&&’ to ‘oh my god.&& how bad it could be.’ ”.&& other experts said the federal health officials had been far too quiet in recent weeks. “i think it would be important for us to get more direction from dr. walensky and dr. fauci as to what we should be doing right now.&&” said dr. janis m. orlowski.&& the chief health care officer at the association of american medical colleges..&& dr. ezekiel emanuel.&& an oncologist.&& medical ethicist and university of pennsylvania professor who led an effort to draft a new pandemic strategy called “the next normal.&&” was more blunt in calling for the white house to improve its covid communications strategy: “they need to step up their game.”.&& by choe sang-hun.&& seoul — when north korea’s leader.&& kim jong-un.&& acknowledged an outbreak of covid-19 last week.&& he ordered his government to learn from ​china’s “success” fighting the virus​.​ ​what he did not say is that an attempt to follow china’s pandemic response could send his impoverished country toward catastrophe..&& china has used strict lockdowns.&& mass testing and vaccinations to keep cases low throughout the pandemic. north korea — which by its own admission is experiencing an explosive outbreak of the virus — lacks the basic therapeutics and food supplies that china has mobilized to enforce the extreme restrictions seen in cities like wuhan.&& xi’an and shanghai..&& now.&& public health experts are warning that mr. kim’s desire to follow the chinese model will only worsen the impact of a fast spreading disaster. already the ​number of new suspected patients in north korea has soared from 18.&&000 last thursday to hundreds of thousands a day this week.&& though it is impossible to know the true scale of the outbreak..&& north korea called itself covid-free for two years until it confirmed an outbreak for the first time last thursday. most people are unvaccinated.&& and the country is so isolated that when an estimated two million people died during a famine in the mid-1990s.&& the outside world didn’t know about it until the bodies of famished north koreans started washing up along the shallow river that borders china..&& without enough testing kits​ to accurately measure the ​size of the ​outbreak.&& north korea has relied on the number of “people found with fevers.&&” not the number who have tested positive for the virus. it has reported 62 deaths out of nearly 1.7 million suspected patients. on wednesday.&& state media claimed a million people had already recovered from fever.&& though experts doubt the numbers being reported by north korea are reliable..&& “i don’t think north korea is honest with the number of deaths.&&” said jacob lee.&& a specialist in infectious diseases at hallym university medical center in south korea.​ “it is likely playing that number down to help control its people​.”.&& north korea cannot feed its own people in the best of times. its state rations system collapsed during the famine in the 1990s and never recovered​.&& leaving people fending for themselves. if north koreans were placed under the kind of extreme lockdowns seen in china.&& outside health experts say.&& the government would be unable to provide basic needs..&& “for north koreans.&& ​that would mean the country going back to the ration system.&&” dr. lee said. “i doubt it will work. even china had difficulties ​with logistics and supplies of food for people in lockdown cities.”.&& north korea appears to be following a strategy similar to china’s.&& but with variations. it has ordered all cities and counties to lock down.&& yet urged them to continue to “organize work and production.” although traffic was banned between cities and counties.&& people are still allowed to move around within their districts and report for work at farms and factories.&& according to asia press.&& a japan-based website that reports on north korea with the help of informants inside the country..&& there was also an extensive campaign to check temperatures at factories and residential compounds.&& and people have been allowed to go to informal markets for food and other necessities.&& according to asia press..&& shutting down the informal markets could be devastating because most north koreans rely on them to supplement their meager government rations. “i don’t think the regime would go so far as to shut down the markets completely.&&” said lee tae-kyung.&& who worked as a physician in north korea until he fled the country in 2006 as part of a stream of refugees. “when it tried to in the past.&& people pushed back.&& shouting at the police. it’s a matter of life or death.”.&& in contrast with mr. kim’s praise for china’s coronavirus policies.&& a growing number of health organizations and global leaders have criticized them as unsustainable. china’s borders remain closed and it has rarely allowed outside experts to visit since the pandemic began. foreign investment is drying up.&& and some educated young people are leaving the country rather than live through another lockdown..&& “countries like south korea could battle an omicron outbreak with relatively low fatalities ​because they had solid public health systems.&& high vaccination rates​ and therapeutics.&& and because their people were relatively healthy and well-fed.&&” said jung jae-hun.&& a professor of preventive medicine at gachon university in south korea.&& referring to a variant of the virus. “north korea has none of those.”.&& the origin of the north korean outbreak is still unclear.&& but in recent weeks.&& ​mr. kim ​mobilized tens of thousands of people without masks for a large military parade in pyongyang.&& the capital.&& to celebrate the country’s growing nuclear capabilities. he also mobilized students and workers to help plant rice in the countryside this month.&& an extremely important task in a nation that suffers chronic grain shortages..&& north korean officials first found infections in a group of college students who attended the military parade.&& including one who apparently got the virus from a relative who had recently visited china.&& said daily nk.&& a seoul-based website that reports on north korea. north korean state media reported that more fever cases had been found in pyongyang.&& as well as in southern provinces where most of the rice​-planting took place..&& when the outbreak was publicized last week.&& it quickly revealed that the secretive nation was desperately unprepared. north korean officials said fever cases began spreading late last month. but as of saturday.&& the country had confirmed only 168 covid cases.&& according to ryu yong-chol.&& a disease-control official who appeared on state television on monday..&& “the medicines provided by the state have not been supplied to inhabitants through pharmacies correctly in time.&&” mr. kim admitted..&& china’s isolationist approach in the pandemic may be what appeals most to mr. kim as he tries to respond to the crisis and maintain his godlike authority over his people. when seoul tried to​ send an invitation to discuss pandemic-related aid this week.&& north korea​ refused to accept it. it has also refused donations from covax.&& the global vaccine program. the country has never officially explained why.&& but it has been reluctant to accept aid shipments that would require that observers be allowed into the country..&& south korean media reported on tuesday that three north korean cargo planes made a round trip to the northeastern chinese city of shenyang on monday to pick up 150 tons of emergency aid. the chinese foreign ministry declined to confirm the report..&& still.&& mr. lee.&& the physician who once worked in north korea.&& doubts that the situation will improve soon. “what you consider bad is different from what the north korean regime considers bad.&&” he said. “when millions died during the famine.&& the regime didn’t flinch.”.&& li you contributed research..&& by pam belluck.&& it’s the most succinct and dispassionate name for long covid: u09.9 — a medical diagnostic code created last year to allow doctors to document post-covid conditions..&& now.&& a large new study has analyzed data from the first few months after the code took effect.&& and the results paint a sobering picture of long covid’s serious and ongoing impact on people’s health and the american health care system..&& long covid.&& a complex constellation of lingering or newly emerging symptoms that can last for months after the initial infection.&& or longer.&& has become one of the most daunting legacies of the pandemic. estimates of how many people may ultimately be affected have ranged from 10 percent to 30 percent of infected adults.&& but much remains unclear about the prevalence.&& causes.&& treatment and consequences of the condition..&& the new study adds to a growing body of evidence that people with mild or moderate initial coronavirus infections.&& and those without any underlying medical conditions.&& can still experience debilitating symptoms ranging from breathing problems to extreme fatigue to cognitive and memory issues..&& the analysis.&& based on what the report calls the largest database of private health insurance claims in the united states.&& found 78.&&252 patients who were diagnosed with the u09.9 code from the international classification of diseases between oct. 1.&& 2021.&& and jan. 31.&& 2022.&& and the vast majority of them had not been hospitalized for their initial infection..&& “it’s generating a pandemic of people who were not hospitalized.&& but who ended up with this increased disability.&&” said dr. paddy ssentongo.&& an assistant professor of infectious disease epidemiology at penn state.&& who was not involved in the new study..&& dr. claire steves.&& a clinical academic and physician at king’s college london.&& who was not involved in the new research.&& said the overall number of people who received the diagnosis was “huge.&&” especially given that the study covered only the first four months after the diagnostic code was introduced and did not include people covered by government health programs like medicaid or medicare (though it did include people in private medicare advantage plans). “that’s probably a drop in the ocean compared to what the real number is.&&” dr. steves said..&& the study.&& conducted by fair health.&& a nonprofit organization that focuses on health care costs and insurance issues.&& found that for 76 percent of the patients.&& the initial coronavirus infection did not make them sick enough to require hospitalization. yet months later.&& they were experiencing symptoms that were diagnosed as post-covid conditions..&& another striking finding was that while two-thirds of the patients had pre-existing health conditions in their medical records.&& nearly a third did not.&& a much larger percentage than dr. ssentongo said he would have expected. “these are people who have been healthy and they’re like.&& ‘guys.&& something is not right with me.&&’” he said..&& the researchers plan to continue to track the patients to see how long their symptoms last.&& but robin gelburd.&& the president of fair health.&& said that the organization decided to publish data from the first four months now.&& “given the urgency” of the issue..&& she said researchers were working to try to answer some of the questions that are not addressed in the report.&& including providing detail on some patients’ previous health conditions to try to identify whether certain medical problems put people at higher risk of long covid..&& the organization also plans to analyze how many patients in the study were vaccinated and when.&& ms. gelburd said. more than three-quarters of the patients in the study were infected in 2021.&& most of those in the last half of the year. on average.&& patients were still experiencing long covid symptoms that qualified for the diagnosis four and a half months after their infection..&& the findings suggest a potentially staggering impact of long covid on people in the prime of their lives.&& and on society at large. nearly 35 percent of the patients were between the ages of 36 to 50.&& while nearly one-third were ages 51 to 64.&& and 17 percent were ages 23 to 35. children were also diagnosed with post-covid conditions: nearly 4 percent of the patients were 12 or younger.&& while nearly 7 percent were between ages 13 and 22..&& six percent of the patients were 65 and older.&& a proportion that most likely reflects the fact that patients covered by the regular medicare program weren’t included in the study. they were much more likely than the younger groups with long covid to have had pre-existing chronic medical conditions..&& the insurance data analyzed did not include information about the race or ethnicity of patients.&& researchers said..&& the analysis.&& which ms. gelburd said was evaluated by an independent academic reviewer but not formally peer-reviewed.&& also calculated a risk score for the patients.&& a way of estimating how likely people are to use health care resources. comparing all the insurance claims the patients had up until 90 days before they contracted covid with their claims 30 days or more after they were infected.&& the study found that average risk scores went up for patients in every age group..&& ms. gelburd and other experts said the scores suggested that the repercussions of long covid are not simply confined to increased medical spending. they signal “how many people are leaving their jobs.&& how many are being given disability status.&& how much absenteeism is there in school.&&” ms. gelburd said. “it’s like a pebble thrown into the lake.&& and these ripples circling that pebble are concentric circles of impact.”.&& because the study captured only a privately insured population.&& dr. ssentongo said.&& it almost certainly understates the scope and burden of long covid.&& especially since low-income communities have been disproportionately affected by the virus and often have less access to health care. “i think it may even be worse if we added in the medicaid population and all these other people that would have been missed” in the study’s data.&& he said..&& sixty percent of the patients with the post-covid diagnosis were female.&& the study reported.&& compared with 54 percent of covid patients overall in the fair health database. in the oldest and youngest age groups.&& however.&& there were roughly as many males as females..&& “i think there is a female preponderance in terms of this condition.&&” dr. steves said.&& adding that the reasons could include differences in biological factors that make women more prone to autoimmune conditions..&& the insurance claims showed that nearly one-quarter of the post-covid patients had respiratory symptoms.&& nearly one-fifth had coughs and 17 percent had been diagnosed with malaise and fatigue.&& a far-reaching category that could include issues like brain fog and exhaustion that gets worse after physical or mental activity. other common issues included abnormal heartbeats and sleep disorders..&& generalized anxiety disorder was more common for 23- to 35-year-olds than for other age groups.&& the study reported.&& while hypertension was more common in the oldest patients..&& last year.&& fair health published a study tracking insurance records of nearly two million people who had contracted covid.&& which found that one month or more after their infection.&& almost one-quarter of them — 23 percent — sought medical treatment for new conditions..&& the new study tried to determine how common certain symptoms were before the patients got infected compared with the period when those same patients were diagnosed with post-covid conditions. it found that some typically uncommon health issues were much more likely to emerge during long covid. for example.&& muscle problems occurred 11 times more often in the patients with long covid.&& pulmonary embolisms occurred 2.6 times more often and certain types of brain-related disorders occurred two times more often.&& the study said..&& like previous studies.&& the report found that if patients did need hospitalization for their initial infection.&& they were at higher risk of long-term symptoms than patients who were not hospitalized. the report came to that conclusion because about 24 percent of the patients diagnosed with a post-covid condition had been hospitalized — more of them male than female — while only about 8 percent of all coronavirus patients needed hospitalization..&& still.&& because the vast majority of people do not need to be hospitalized for their infection.&& medical experts said that this and other studies indicate that many people with mild or moderate initial illness will end up with lingering symptoms or new post-covid health problems..&& ms. gelburd and medical experts said that as doctors become more acquainted with the u09.9 code.&& they might use it in different circumstances than they did in the first four months..&& given the likely scale of long covid.&& dr. ssentongo said he expects that in the future doctors will ask patients if they have ever been diagnosed with post-covid conditions.&& just as doctors ask about other previous medical problems so they can treat patients appropriately..&& “post-covid syndrome is going to become perhaps one of the most common pre-existing comorbidities going forward.&&” he said..&& by michael paulson.&& deirdre o’connell.&& a veteran stage actress who notched her first tony nomination this year by mesmerizingly lip-syncing 75 minutes of harrowing

o’connell.&& who starred in “dana h..&&” told jackson how happy she was for him.&& and that “he’s changing the world.&& and i’m really glad.” the admiration.&& it turned.&& out.&& was mutual: jackson.&& whose boundary-busting show “a strange loop” is nominated for best musical.&& liked “dana h.” so much he went twice. “i saw opening night and i screamed.&& ‘finally! something good!’” jackson said. “and then i came back to see it again.”.&& at the end of a bumpy broadway season that started late and was repeatedly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.&& the once-ordinary rituals of tonys time have taken on a new significance this spring.&& as a beleaguered theater industry grasps for reassurance that some kind of new normal is just around the corner. sure.&& the gatherings

once-dominant producer accused of bullying behavior; and the diminution of tourism.&& long an economic lifeblood for broadway..&& nonetheless.&& 34 plays and musicals managed to open this season.&&

theater.&& kicking off broadway’s staggered reopening. here’s a look at some of the ways this season was one for the books..&& ninety minutes before curtain one night in late april.&& the company of “a strange loop” gathered inside an empty lyceum theater and formed a circle onstage. it was the long-awaited opening night for the new musical.&& and.&& even though covid had forced the show to scrap a planned party.&& the production was determined to make the night memorable..&& the lead producer bestowed plush robes — one zebra-patterned.&& one tiger.&& one cheetah — on the three members of the cast with broadway experience. then.&& in a homage to an actors’ equity ritual for shows with choruses.&& those broadway veterans ran around the circle three times.&& allowing each member of the company to touch their robes.&& and seeking a blessing for a long and successful run..&& “this has been a long time coming.&& in so many ways.&&” jackson.&& who was 23 when he started writing the show and is now 41.&& said in an emotional curtain speech several hours later.&& after a prolonged standing ovation from a star-studded crowd that included queen latifah and bryan cranston..&& “a strange loop.&&” billing itself as a “big.&& black & queer-ass american musical.&&” was among the bounty of shows by black writers to open on broadway this season — almost certainly the most in history.&& reflecting what appeared to be a new openness to such work on the part of theater owners and producers facing pressure.&& and criticism.&& following the unrest over racial injustice that roiled america in the summer of 2020..&& the season brought five new plays by black writers — “chicken & biscuits.&&” “clyde’s.&&” “pass over.&&” “skeleton crew” and “thoughts of a colored man” — as well as revivals of “for colored girls.&&” “lackawanna blues” and “trouble in mind.&&” and a reprise run of “slave play.” also.&& the three new musicals that received the most tony nominations — “a strange loop.&&” “mj” and “paradise square” — all had black book writers..&& how did they fare? artistically.&& many were well received — the revivals were generally praised by critics.&& as were some of the new plays..&& financially.&& however.&& it was a different picture. none of the plays.&& as often happens with plays.&& were a financial success. in the fall both “chicken & biscuits” and “thoughts of a colored man” cut their runs short. and an acclaimed revival of “for colored girls” has struggled to attract audiences and announced an early closing date.&& though its grosses ticked up last week bolstered by seven tony nominations and a pay-it-forward social media campaign to get tickets in the hands of people who might otherwise not be able to afford them..&& but the high number of shows with black authors.&& as well as the intensified focus on the underrepresentation of people of color on broadway creative teams.&& led to far more opportunities for black theater artists.&& onstage and off. and that.&& in turn.&& meant more opportunities for black actors and designers to compete during awards season: the tony nominations featured an unusually broad array of black nominees..&& will black writers continue to be produced in such abundance? next season is still taking shape.&& but at this stage it appears that the there will be more work by black writers than there had been prepandemic.&& but not as much as this season.&& and with more of an emphasis on established writers than emerging artists. thus far.&& only a revival of august wilson’s “the piano lesson” appears certain.&& but others are circling..&& also noteworthy: after a season in which the diversity discussion focused on work by black writers.&& next season is expected to have at least two musicals whose creative teams include asian or asian american writers.&& “kpop” and “come fall in love — the ddlj musical.”.&& black artists say they’ll be watching to see whether the industry’s commitment to greater diversity continues. “i’m feeling hopeful.&&” aduba said. “but i’m sleeping with one eye open.”.&& on the last friday of april.&& the propmasters for “girl from the north country” gathered

singular complication: it opened so few days before the shutdown that not enough tony voters got to see it.&& so it was moved into a different season for eligibility consideration. the show never loaded out of the belasco — its set has been there for 27 months.&& even though it has been performed only for four..&& on that late april day.&& an hour before curtain.&& the cast.&& with a handful

last few years.&& the journey that we’ve been on.&& while at times frightening and filled with disappointment and anxiety.&& has brought us all together.&& and kept us together.”.&& others offered

and now the show is a tony nominee (as is its rebuilt set)..&& the most on-brand resurrection.&& of course.&& is that of “beetlejuice.&&” the 2019 show that begs for back-from-the-dead wordplay given

she wanted to see “the music man.”.&& “she made it very clear her number one wish was seeing hugh jackman.&& so i bought the tickets.&& and made it clear that this was for mother’s day and her birthday.&&” said klein.&& a 43-year-old children’s books editor from brooklyn.&& alluding to the show’s highest-on-broadway ticket prices. “it was a great show; my mother said it was her best afternoon in years.&& and that’s the show tourists are loving. you don’t always want to be challenged.”.&& in a year when so much adventurous theater reached broadway — from “is this a room.&&” a staged adaptation of an f.b.i. transcript.&& to “flying over sunset.&&” a psychedelic musical in which characters sing while tripping on l.s.d. — the biggest hits were all big brands. most shows struggled at a softened box office.&& and the exceptions.&& often despite poor reviews.&& were shows with established titles and established stars..&& exhibit a is “the music man.&&” a by-the-book revival that underwhelmed critics.&& but since opening in february has been consistently.&& and by far.&& the best-selling show on broadway.&& grossing more than $3 million a week and scoring six tony awards nominations.&& including best revival of a musical..&& “there’s a certain comfort with shows you know.&& and to see them performed well.&& and the energy in the theater was fantastic.&&” said amber benson.&& a 45-year-old advertising executive from fort worth.&& who took her mother.&& her sister and her niece to see the musical. “it’s the perfect kind of show to remind you why you love broadway.”.&& but “the music man” is only the most visible evidence of a wide gap between the broadway haves and have-nots..&& the best-selling play of the moment is a revival of “plaza suite” that also drew tepid reviews.&& but is outgrossing all but a handful of shows thanks to the star power of its principal actors.&& the married couple sarah jessica parker and matthew broderick..&& there are many other examples. a poorly reviewed production of “macbeth” has been playing to packed houses.&& presumably thanks to the curb appeal of the movie star playing the title character.&& daniel craig..&& the other top-grossing new shows are a revival of “funny girl” — a beloved title.&& even if this production disappointed critics; the new musical “mj.&&” about the enormously popular pop star michael jackson; and “six.&&” which arrived on broadway already a sensation fueled by social media..&& those shows are overpowering others that don’t have recognizable stars or subjects.&& like a revival of the pulitzer prize-winning “the skin of our teeth.&&” which is playing to houses with rows of empty seats.&& and “paradise square.&&” which is hoping its 10 tony nods will help persuade ticket buyers who thus far have largely stayed away..&& “this used to be a business where you had big winners.&& some that closed.&& and those that kept running and did ok.&&” said the producer roy furman.&& who invested in “mj.&&” “funny girl” and “mr. saturday night.” “but there’s almost no middle anymore. now the business is trending where either you’re powerful.&& or you’re weak.”.&& this was the season of the first “funny girl” revival. it was the season that alice childress.&& the author of “trouble in mind.&&” finally made it to broadway.&& 66 years after a first attempt and 27 years after the no-longer-overlooked playwright’s death. it was the season of a musical about princess diana.&& a play about the lehman brothers.&& and a farce about the women propping up an incompetent president..&& but mostly.&& it was the season when broadway learned to live with covid..&& “we all got it like a revolving door.&&” said the actress and comedian rachel dratch.&& now a tony nominee for her portrayal of a tightly wound presidential aide in that farce.&& which is called “potus.” dratch was the fourth member of the seven-woman cast to test positive during rehearsals. “i was like.&& ‘even me?’”.&& understudies became the season’s heroes: one night at “come from away.&&” nine of the 12 performers were standbys.&& including alumni and members of touring companies flown in to help out. at “thoughts of a colored man.&&” the playwright performed to save a night; at “macbeth.&&” the director did the same. last week.&& at “girl from the north country.&&” the actor anthony edwards.&& best known for “er.&&” stepped onstage with a script after just an hour of rehearsal.&& eager to help a show that stars his tony-nominated wife.&& mare winningham..&& that resourcefulness has curtailed show cancellations.&& but hasn’t eliminated them. last weekend.&& “moulin rouge!.&&” which last year won the tony award for best musical.&& canceled four performances.&& while “the skin of our teeth” canceled three..&& and coping with covid has been costly. for instance.&& one midsize production.&& the tony-nominated revival of “caroline.&& or change.&&” spent an additional $10.&&000 to $15.&&000 each week on pandemic precautions.&& according to sydney beers.&& the executive producer at roundabout theater company.&& which presented the show..&& roundabout increased its spending on immigration lawyers — the show’s tony-nominated star.&& sharon d clarke.&& and six members of its creative team are british.&& and when rehearsals resumed.&& travel was still restricted. the theater hired extra understudies.&& knowing covid might lead to more absences. and it built a three-person covid safety team that ran 7.&&000 pcr tests during the show’s three months.&& testing every employee at least three times a week.&& and sometimes daily.&& depending on city caseloads..&& “there was a definite sacrifice everybody made on the more social aspects — there was no opening night party.&& and they couldn’t bring friends and family backstage.&&” said lauren fitzgerald veit.&& the show’s covid safety supervisor. “but everyone was ready to do whatever they had to do.”.&& there were costs. there were complications. but there were also new stories told.&& and new talent discovered..&& “i didn’t realize how hungry i was to be back at work.&& and back on the stage.&& especially here in new york.&& where the theater community was just devastated by the pandemic.&&” said ruth negga.&& who was performing off broadway in “hamlet” until four days before the shutdown.&& and then returned post-shutdown to make her broadway debut in “macbeth.&&” picking up a tony nomination in the process. “it’s not over.&& but i think there’s a heady sense of relief that we can actually go on.”.&& by isabella grullón paz.&& ashley biden.&& the daughter of president biden and the first lady.&& jill biden.&& tested positive for the coronavirus and will no longer

recommend the booster dose after an advisory committee of outside experts meets to discuss it on thursday..&& that would make all americans 5 and older eligible for a booster shot. but booster uptake has been much slower than public health experts hoped; many parents have been reluctant to vaccinate children in this age group at all..&& although they have been eligible for covid shots since

said: “while it has largely been the case that covid-19 tends to be less severe in children than adults.&& the omicron wave has seen more kids getting sick with the disease and being hospitalized.&& and children may also experience longer-term effects.&& even following initially mild disease.”.&& some experts have suggested that because children 5 to 11 received a much lower initial dose than

percent from 68 percent by four to five weeks after the second dose..&& another c.d.c. study stated that two pfizer doses reduced the risk of omicron infection by 31 percent among those 5 to 11.&& compared with a 59 percent reduction in risk among those 12 to 15. dr. peter marks.&& the f.d.a.’s top vaccine regulator.&& said that “emerging data suggest that vaccine effectiveness against covid-19
