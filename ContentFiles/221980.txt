[the website uses cookies in order to offer you the most relevant information. please, accept cookies for optimal performance. more information, the risk list is a catalogue of all objects for which a non-zero impact probability has been computed. each entry contains details on the particular earth approach which poses the highest risk of impact (as expressed by the palermo scale). it includes its date, size, velocity and probability. impact history data can be selected in tabular and graphical form. links to the impactor table, the physical properties and orbit visualiser are given. in most cases, the size presented in the table is estimated indirectly from the absolute magnitude, and flagged with an asterisk to denote that its uncertainty is large. when a better measurement is available in the literature, it replaces the estimated value. by default, entries are sorted by the maximum palermo scale value; the sorting can be changed by clicking on the table headers., copyright 2000 - 2022 european space agency. all rights reserved.][near-earth objects coordination centre, risk list, risk list, , risk list, special risk list, ]risk list - neo[][neocc home, about neocc, european space agency, space safety programme safety and security planetary defence office space weather space debris clean space, safety and security, planetary defence office, space weather, space debris, clean space, main services risk list close approaches list priority list newsletters archive cafs archive news archive, risk list, close approaches list, priority list, newsletters archive, cafs archive, news archive, search asteroids comets fits images fireballs, asteroids, comets, fits images, fireballs, tools orbit visualiser neo population generator neo propagator, orbit visualiser, neo population generator, neo propagator, outreach neo chronology discovery statistics neocc riddles media entries gallery public outreach definitions & assumptions faq pdc 2021 impact exercise, neo chronology, discovery statistics, neocc riddles, media entries, gallery, public outreach, definitions & assumptions, faq, pdc 2021 impact exercise, external links precoveries through ssois fireballs through imo iawn smpag other links, precoveries through ssois, fireballs through imo, iawn, smpag, other links, other system status automated data access subscribe to services contact us terms & conditions privacy policy, system status, automated data access, subscribe to services, contact us, terms & conditions, privacy policy, european space agency, space safety programme safety and security planetary defence office space weather space debris clean space, safety and security, planetary defence office, space weather, space debris, clean space, contact us, sign in, main neocc home about neocc, neocc home, about neocc, main services risk list close approaches list priority list newsletters archive cafs archive news archive, risk list, close approaches list, priority list, newsletters archive, cafs archive, news archive, search asteroids comets fits images fireballs, asteroids, comets, fits images, fireballs, tools orbit visualiser neo population generator neo propagator, orbit visualiser, neo population generator, neo propagator, outreach discovery statistics neo chronology neocc riddles media entries gallery public outreach definitions & assumptions faq pdc 2021 impact exercise, discovery statistics, neo chronology, neocc riddles, media entries, gallery, public outreach, definitions & assumptions, faq, pdc 2021 impact exercise, external links precoveries through ssois fireballs through imo iawn smpag other links, precoveries through ssois, fireballs through imo, iawn, smpag, other links, other system status automated data access subscribe to services contact us, system status, automated data access, subscribe to services, contact us, system status, terms & conditions, privacy policy]
