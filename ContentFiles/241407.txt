wind out of the room. to me.&& that sort of “viewing product” has very little to do with anything we can agree is cinema or cinematic. the only thing it has in common with cinema is that it’s light projected on a screen; it’s garbage that is increasingly taking up valuable space in venues formerly known as movie theatres..&& as a cineaste.&& the really exciting and innovative viewing is to be found in some of the curated retrospectives.&& such as the great films presented by the museum of modern art’s “to save and project series.” it’s absolutely thrilling.&& for example.&& to see the

own work in many of these experimental festivals. i have included only a short list of the myriad international film festivals that screen abstract.&& experimental and avant-garde work.&& much of it short films. the celebration of the short experimental film is so important.&& because they remind us why we fell in love with cinema to begin with.&& and it has nothing to do with budgets or stars.&& or even narrative; instead it has to do with a love of radical experimentation in the form and the medium.&& whether it be hand-painting and scratching films.&& to hand-animating experimental one-of-a-kind personal cinema..&& experimental underground cinema springs not from the love of money.&& but from a love of film as an art form and it is at these underground experimental film

varying degrees in 2021.&& film festivals did happen in actual cinemas.&& but things were far from normal. many cinemas remained closed in some countries and numerous film festivals took place in a hybrid manner (virtual + physical cinema) while some stayed completely online. as 2021 progressed.&& it became clear that big studios would still prevail and be able to dump their product whenever they wanted and in whatever fashion. meanwhile.&& independent and foreign films suffered as they were not able to depend on film festival buzz to gain traction. to complicate matters.&& some distributors insisted on purity of cinema and only wanted to show their film in physical cinemas. that immediately put many cities out of reach.&& including my city. so as 2021 is about to end.&& it is crystal clear that it is becoming very very difficult to legally see quality cinema while there is no shortage of means to see hollywood films..&& still.&& it was heartening to see that good films continued to be made even though it was tougher to see them. i am thankful that some canadian film festivals (thank you gimli film festival.&& fantasia.&& festival du nouveau cinéma) made some of their incredible selections easily available online across canada..&& here are 10 of my favourite films from 2021. i truly hope that some of these films are widely released in 2022. 1. the great indian kitchen (jeo baby.&& 2021) as the title indicates.&& there is food in the movie which will cause one to get hungry. however.&& it becomes apparent that the film is more than about food and the kitchen is more than just a space to make food. even though this film is rooted in south india.&& aspects about marriage and treatment of women are applicable to many other patriarchal societies around the world. a highly relevant and urgent film. 2. wheel of fortune and fantasy (ryûsuke hamaguchi.&& 2021) the first of the two hamaguchi films released in 2021 is pure cinematic delight. the playful structure.&& including abrupt zooms.&& reminds of hong sang-soo’s cinema but the honesty and mature stories are a continuation of ideas from his earlier happy hour. another lovely surprise is the inclusion of an element that reflects our current pandemic world. 3. întregalde (radu muntean.&& 2021) there are no vampires in this contemplative film set in transylvania yet there are elements of morality and ethics that are relevant to our world today. those elements centre around doing good for others at the expense of one’s needs. 4. le monde après nous (the world after us.&& louda ben salah-cazanas.&& 2021) a charming parisian film that balances the sweetness of romance in paris with the bitterness of a writer’s struggles. 5. a night of knowing nothing (payal kapadia.&& 2021) payal kapadia’s beautiful poetic film shows that despite decades of progress.&& many things haven’t changed in india (or the world in general). in fact.&& some things are regressing including basic human rights. 6. fire in the mountains (ajitpal singh.&& 2021) a remarkable film which derives its power with a smart mix of dry humour and plenty of heart. in the hands of another filmmaker.&& this could have been a completely dramatic film but ajitpal incorporates many light hearted touches that elevates the film. 7. faya dayi (jessica beshir.&& 2021) an immersive.&& hypnotic and poetic journey to harar! with a photographer’s soul.&& beshir lovingly captures the myths and rituals around khat along with its growth.&& sale and consumption. 8. aleph (iva radivojevic.&& 2021) smartly uses a jorge luis borges short story as a spring board to explore diverse stories in buenos aires.&& greeland.&& kathmandu.&& new york city and the sahara. easily one of the most creative films of the year! 9. pebbles (p.s. vinothraj.&& 2021) the film depicts the harness of the main character against the backdrop of an unfolding environmental disaster. that point may not be apparent at first but is hammered home by the quietly powerful final scene. 10. mbah jhiwo (ancient soul.&& álvaro gurrea.&& 2021) as most of the world shifted to comfortable online remote working.&& gurrea’s film shows the brutal reality of dangers some people face in their jobs. ancient soul shows the life of yono.&& a sulphur miner in java.&& as he navigates his dangerous job while dealing with the complex questions around why his wife left him. the mine shots evokes michael glawogger’s workingman’s death while some of the spiritual themes have a touch of apichatpong’s style to them. honourable mentions (alphabetical

over the early american colonies..&& titane (julia ducournau.&&2021).&& a seriously frantic.&& surrealistic body horror body film. agatha roussette in her first feature film debut as alexia. her

i saw the film with a tired but rowdy late night crowd at event george street as part of sydney film fest.&& a cinema which i feel this film was made for….&& another incredible film i was lucky enough to see at sff. i’m not one to like or indulge netflix context but i couldn’t help myself to watch this film. i feel anything shot in or around naples automatically looks beautiful.&& but this film is so much more than that. it was both hilarious.&& inspiring.&& indulgent.&& and completely devastating.&& much like sorrentino’s other films… .&& a film that evoked the same kind of dread i felt watching good time and victoria. although arguably having the least marketable title ever created.&& the film was a major highlight of both the venice ff and my year watching films. when we follow our blind protagonist on the train and he starts interacting with the world.&& you can almost feel something bad is going to happen.&& but you never really see it.&& which makes it even more stressful. i also watched this on a link so extra props for it being able to hold my fragile attention span. i sincerely hope it gets a cinematic release in 2k22..&& i am biased as this is a hi gloss title but watching this both on a link and at the sydney ff proved to be two unique and thoroughly entertaining viewing experiences. tense but also intrinsically humorous and critical.&& a hero is up there with fireworks wednesday as my favourite farhadi film..&& a close second favourite documentary of the year. it looked incredible.&& focused on old.&& cute and mostly grumpy italian men but was also shot with a critical eye. there are also truly gut-wrenching moments in this film as well. it reminds me of julien faraut’s works – which unlike the popular yet tedious ‘netflixy’ talking heads with dramatic music over the top style of storytelling.&& was able to let the footage do most of the talking. .&& i loved raw so i needed to find a spot for this film in my top 10 list. i suspect this film ‘could’ve been better’ but there were so many moments of pure cinematic magic that kept me as the viewer interested. i couldn’t help but shake off parallels with the imposter which i truly hope julia ducournau used as inspiration. speaking of – i wish vincent lindon got more praise for his misguided/ lonely/ juiced up fireman / father role..&& i always like to put a big hollywood film into my top 10 and although this theme park adaptation (which according to wikipedia is the 11th film adapted from a disney attraction) is critically a very average film –  i had so much fun watching it in a cinema that i had to include it in the 10. come for paul giamatti’s crude italian accent.&& stay for the rock is his people’s choice award winning performance as explorer / spanish conquistador frank wolff / francisco lopez de heredia.  .&& licorice pizza the worst person in the world the lost daughter the father red rocket.&& 2021 films:.&& doraibu mai kâ (drive my car.&& ryûsuke hamaguchi) outside noise (ted fendt) the velvet underground (todd haynes) ras vkhedavt.&& rodesac cas vukurebt?
