[reviews / at home.&& in 1999 the new york times undertook an ambitious public project: they built a giant time capsule sculpture filled with the most iconic objects from the 20th century. the time capsule is meant to be opened in the year 3000 (an optimistic goal.&& given our record of human tomfoolery). among the miscellany inside the capsule.&& such as a can of spam and a betty crocker cookbook.&& there lies a chia pet.&& waiting for its next life among modern advances like flying cars and planes with adequate legroom. but.&& who knows? maybe chia pets won’t be a thing of the past in the year 3000. after all.&& they’ve lasted this long. .&& in 1977 ad agency owner joe pedott of joseph enterprises.&& inc..&& attended a housewares show in chicago.&& where he learned about the chia pet.&& a well-performing if underrepresented curiosity owned by a canadian company. seeing green (literally).&& he bought the rights to market the chia pet.&& then flew to mexico to witness the oaxacan artists using chia seeds in their pottery creations.&& a tradition going back centuries to the aztecs who relied on chia crops. in mexico the lush clime and sunny weather encourages talented artists to create ornamental garden sculptures of all kinds. on religious and ceremonial ofrendas.&& chia pottery is often featured in the weeks leading up to the event. for a time.&& chia pets were exclusively created in mexico.&& though they are now manufactured in china..&& there are two main components. first.&& a terra-cotta sculpture in the shape of.&& literally.&& anything your heart can conjure. you soak the sculpture so it becomes a habitable environment for the all-important chia seeds. as anyone who’s been to a modern health food store knows.&& when chia seeds are wet.&& they gain a gluey consistency.&& similar to jam. that texture makes them adhere to surfaces.&& particularly those that are ridged or grooved. chia seeds are extremely hydrophilic.&& absorbing up to 300 times their weight in water. they are actually a kind of sage plant (also referred to as salvia hispanica) and are commonly eaten in gelatinous puddings or on top of smoothie bowls. but it’s not recommended to eat your pet’s chia seeds. they exist for another.&& higher purpose..&& once the viscous chia seeds gain the correct texture.&& you spread them on top of the terra-cotta sculpture.&& designed with grooves to keep the chia seeds secure. after a week or two of watering.&& the sprouts emerge.&& creating a dense.&& curly texture that interacts with the terra-cotta to create a playful illusion of hair or fur. part of the fun is “trimming” your hirsute pets and shaping their chia sprouts.&& as you would a hedge or bush..&& as for the infamous “ch-ch-chia” slogan that still runs through our heads in random moments of adult life? pedott claims that at an ad agency brainstorming session.&& someone stammered over the word “chia.&&” resulting in the now iconic commercial that plays around christmastime each year. (some sources say that this burst of ingenuity actually happened at a bar.&& but who’s to say?) whatever the origin story.&& the marketing campaign clearly worked. since the ’70s.&& there have been at least 25 million chia pets sold in the u.s. alone. they are mostly given as gifts.&& it appears.&& so their peak acquisition season is during the holidays. .&& these plants are popular because of how low-maintenance they are.&& making them essentially perfect for lazy people of all ages. there’s no soil or potting.&& and their greatest risk is overflow from overzealous watering. (you should put a plate underneath the terra-cotta sculpture to catch water.)  the chia pets’ halcyon age was in the 1980s.&& a markedly rich time for useless curiosities. there’s even a science fiction novel called idoru.&& in which the main character is named chia pet. there’s a chia pet in the smithsonian institute.&& along with the aforementioned new york times capsule. if you choose to celebrate.&& national chia pet day is on november 29. i’m not sure how you celebrate such a holiday.&& except for the purchase of more chia pets..&& though the first chia pet prototype came in human form—aptly named chia guy—they now range in many.&& many variations curated for each chia grower’s tastes. there are the all-popular animals.&& like the ram design that put chia pets on the map in 1982.&& as well as pop culture icons like weird al.&& elvira.&& and my personal favorite.&& bob ross. in the year leading up to the 2016 presidential election.&& the owners of the chia pet company decided to track the purchases of their popular hillary clinton and donald trump chia pets; donald trump outperformed hillary clinton by more than 70 percent.&& effectively predicting the outcome of that year’s election. (the predecessors to these chia presidents were two versions of president barack obama: determined obama and happy obama.) with another election on the horizon.&& who knows—maybe the chia pet can again make its prescient mark on history..&& recently.&& my daughter came home with a patch of grass growing in a plastic cup decorated with googly eyes. i realized that her teacher had essentially made a version of a chia pet. wait until my kid gets her hands on a real one. she’ll be part of a tradition going back centuries.&& to the original mexican artists who found an ingenuous way to merge the natural world with playful human creativity..&& here are a few chia pets we’re eyeing for our household:.&& kids will enjoy seeing this little hedgehog’s “spikes” emerge. less prickly and definitely way less difficult to keep in the house..&& if you enjoy happy things.&& particularly clouds and trees.&& you might be drawn to this smiling bob ross chia pet. maybe in his spare time.&& he added happy little chias to his landscapes. one can dream..&& those who enjoy some magic with their gardening will like this unicorn.&& whose sides are grooved to allow the chia pets to grow outward.&& instead of upward..&& for those feeling patriotic.&& you can display your love of country and chia through a dignified statue of liberty pet that promises solemn contemplation along with luscious chia hair. .&& star wars fans can admire the child’s (baby yoda.&& to some) adorably wise face as they watch sprouts grow around his bassinet..&& our favorite sponge-anoid friend can live on your windowsill or desk.&& sparking smiles as you sing the addictive theme song while watering his “hair.”.&& ward off curses.&& sicilian or otherwise.&& with your own sophia chia pet. of course.&& those iconic ’80s curls are the star feature of this bespectacled icon.][the history of chia pets and our favorite designs, what exactly is a chia pet?, ch-ch-chia, prophetic pets, buy your own, hedgehog chia pet, chia bob ross, chia unicorn, statue of chia, the child chia pet, spongebob chia pet, golden girls sophia pet, featured product, everlane canvas utility boot, more you might like, how to make the perfect cup of espresso, the best houseplants for plant killers, benefits of weighted blankets, according to occupational therapists, how you can save time with pressure cookers, new & noteworthy, how to make the perfect cup of espresso, the best kids tablets, according to technophiles, the best houseplants for plant killers, benefits of weighted blankets, according to occupational therapists]chia pet history and a few favorite designs | reviews by britannica[every product is independently curated by our reviews team., hedgehog chia pet, chia bob ross, chia unicorn, statue of chia, the child chia pet, spongebob chia pet, golden girls sophia pet][]
