[spring framework is an open source java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust java applications very easily and very rapidly. spring framework was initially written by rod johnson and was first released under the apache 2.0 license in june 2003. this tutorial has been written based on spring framework version 4.1.6 released in mar 2015., spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise java. millions of developers around the world use spring framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code., spring framework is an open source java platform. it was initially written by rod johnson and was first released under the apache 2.0 license in june 2003., spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. the basic version of spring framework is around 2mb., the core features of the spring framework can be used in developing any java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the java ee platform. spring framework targets to make j2ee development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a pojo-based programming model., following is the list of few of the great benefits of using spring framework −, pojo based - spring enables developers to develop enterprise-class applications using pojos. the benefit of using only pojos is that you do not need an ejb container product such as an application server but you have the option of using only a robust servlet container such as tomcat or some commercial product., modular - spring is organized in a modular fashion. even though the number of packages and classes are substantial, you have to worry only about the ones you need and ignore the rest., integration with existing frameworks - spring does not reinvent the wheel, instead it truly makes use of some of the existing technologies like several orm frameworks, logging frameworks, jee, quartz and jdk timers, and other view technologies., testablity - testing an application written with spring is simple because environment-dependent code is moved into this framework. furthermore, by using javabeanstyle pojos, it becomes easier to use dependency injection for injecting test data., web mvc - spring's web framework is a well-designed web mvc framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as struts or other over-engineered or less popular web frameworks., central exception handling - spring provides a convenient api to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by jdbc, hibernate, or jdo, for example) into consistent, unchecked exceptions., lightweight - lightweight ioc containers tend to be lightweight, especially when compared to ejb containers, for example. this is beneficial for developing and deploying applications on computers with limited memory and cpu resources., transaction management - spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a single database, for example) and scale up to global transactions (using jta, for example)., this tutorial is designed for java programmers with a need to understand the spring framework in detail along with its architecture and actual usage. this tutorial will bring you at an intermediate level of expertise, from where you can take yourself to higher levels of expertise., before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a good understanding of java programming language. a basic understanding of eclipse ide is also required because all the examples have been compiled using eclipse ide., 102 lectures 8 hours, karthikeya t, 39 lectures 5 hours, chaand sheikh, 73 lectures 5.5 hours, senol atac, 62 lectures 4.5 hours, senol atac, 67 lectures 4.5 hours, senol atac, 69 lectures 5 hours, senol atac, , we make use of cookies to improve our user experience. by using this website, you agree with our cookies policy. agree learn more][spring tutorial, why to learn spring?, applications of spring, audience, prerequisites, useful video courses]spring tutorial[][academic tutorials big data & analytics computer programming computer science databases devops digital marketing engineering tutorials exams syllabus famous monuments gate exams tutorials latest technologies machine learning mainframe development management tutorials mathematics tutorials microsoft technologies misc tutorials mobile development java technologies python technologies sap tutorials programming scripts selected reading software quality soft skills telecom tutorials upsc ias exams web development sports tutorials xml technologies multi-language interview questions, academic tutorials, big data & analytics, computer programming, computer science, databases, devops, digital marketing, engineering tutorials, exams syllabus, famous monuments, gate exams tutorials, latest technologies, machine learning, mainframe development, management tutorials, mathematics tutorials, microsoft technologies, misc tutorials, mobile development, java technologies, python technologies, sap tutorials, programming scripts, selected reading, software quality, soft skills, telecom tutorials, upsc ias exams, web development, sports tutorials, xml technologies, multi-language, interview questions, spring core basics, spring -
