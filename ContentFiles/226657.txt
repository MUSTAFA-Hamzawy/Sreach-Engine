[geeksforgeeks seeking the importance of school learning started to create class-wise subject notes. physics class 11 notes is one of them. physics is a complex subject that requires a lot of conceptual, practical, and revision understanding. therefore, we at geeksforgeeks provide well-developed class 11 physics notes, that cover all the topics from scratch to hatch. class 11 physics notes contain 15 chapters covering topics like measurement, vectors, kinematics, dynamics, rotational motion, laws of motion, gravitation, elasticity, hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, calorimetry, oscillations, waves and many more. thus, we have covered them all chapterwise, with detailed explanations of concepts, examples, and solved problems on them. , , the first chapter in class 11 physics is the physical world. the physical world is referred to as the complexity in nature and solving its own complexities will give us new insights into this physical world. it is referred to as the analysis of nature conducted in order to understand how the world around us performs. we have covered some crucial topics like the relation of physics with other sciences, fundamental forces of nature, and many more in the articles listed below:, units and measurement is the second chapter in the physics curriculum of class 11, which is the most basic and crucial chapter because it works everywhere in physics. units and measurement which is given in the class 11 physics textbook offer basic knowledge about how the quantities are measured and the types of units that are used with them. therefore, we have covered topics like system of units, error in measurements significant figure, dimensional analysis, etc are listed below:, the third chapter is motion in a straight line. this is the first chapter of kinematics in the physics syllabus of class 11. geeksforgeeks class 11 physics notes covers the essential terms related to kinematics like motion in one dimension and important terms related to it, rest and motion, position, distance, and placement, difference between speed and velocity, etc along with solved conceptual and numerical problems on it., the fourth chapter in class 11 physics is motion in a plane. motion in a plane is the motion in 2 dimensions, for instance, projectile motion, circular motion, and so on. geeksforgeeks class 11 physics notes on motion in a plane cover the basics of motion in two dimensions, scalar and vector – unit vector, parallel vectors, addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication of vectors, average and instantaneous velocity, position vector and displacement, projectile motion and many more others that are listed below:, laws of motion is an important chapter of class 11 physics. in our crucial 11th class physics notes, you will understand what is force and the laws of motion. the chapter covers the definition of force and basic forces, newton’s law of motion, linear momentum, principle of conservation of momentum., chapter 6 in the physics curriculum of class 11 is work energy and power. this is one of the most important and basic that have many formulas and equations on work, power, and energy. work is said to be done when a force applied on the body displaces the body through a certain distance in the direction of the force. these topic-wise concepts in the chapter work, energy and power helps to understand the concept of work and dimensions of the unit of work, different forms of energies like potential energy and kinetic energy, and its relationship with momentum. along with the most useful topics like mass-energy relationships, power, etc are discussed in a detailed manner in the articles listed below:, physics class 11 has a seventh chapter named systems of particles and rotational motion based on the syllabus. geeksforgeeks provide detailed knowledge of how the system of particles moves in our daily lives. the main focus is on the topics like kinematics of a system of particles, various types of motions like translational motion, rotational motion, and rotational plus translational motion rotational dynamics. this comprises of newtons’ laws, the moment of inertia, and theorems related to these concepts, angular momentum, impulse, etc are discussed in the following articles as mentioned below:, gravitation is the eighth chapter in the class 11 physics syllabus. in geeksforgeeks physics notes, this chapter contains the explanation on the topics like the law of gravitation given by newton and many examples and problems that will clarify this law to the students. topics like newton’s law of gravitation, variation in g based on the distance of the object above the earth’s surface, satellite – how a satellite is projected to form a circular orbit
