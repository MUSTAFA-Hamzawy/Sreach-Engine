[.&& .&& for many intents.&& the best response from an app is a quick inline answer or a simple confirmation that an action was taken. you can fulfill those intents with an android slice.&& rather than a deep link.&& to provide a user with information directly in google assistant..&& try the sample.&& google automatically renders the app name and the logo of the play store listing in the header of the slice.&& and the open app button in the footer of the slice. a user can tap on the slice to follow a deep link into the app if more information or additional interaction is needed..&& for example.&& using the actions.intent.get_invoice built-in intent.&& your banking app can implement a custom slice that assistant displays when the user utters the invocation phrase.&& check my upcoming bills. in the slice.&& you can show real time data for the users bill..&& android slices work best when a user asks for a small piece of information that can be displayed in a line or two of text. use deep link fulfillment instead when a user wants to perform a task in your app or start a task that requires further interaction..&& you can implement slices with the actions.xml functionality or shortcuts.xml functionality. implementation with the shortcuts.xml file is currently in beta.&& while the actions.xml file implementation is for production use..&& select a button below to choose which implementation method you want to use..&& to integrate app actions with your slices.&& follow these steps:.&& when a slice is used for fulfillment.&& the url-template refers to the slice uri as described in the sliceprovider. the url-template must be of the type content://{slice_authority}/... where slice_authority is the authority defined in the androidmanifest.xml file..&& the following snippet shows how you might specify a slice as the fulfillment for the create_taxi_reservation built-in intent in your shortcuts.xml file:.&& for a given capability.&& you can specify multiple <slice> blocks or use a combination of <slice> and <intent> blocks for fulfillment. this approach lets you provide a customized experience based on different combinations of parameters that the user specifies. for example.&& if the user does not specify any drop-off location in their query.&& you can direct them to the activity in your app that shows options for setting the pick-up and drop-off locations. for more information about adding fallback intents.&& see create shortcuts.xml..&& note that.&& similar to multiple <intent> blocks.&& multiple <slice> blocks or a combination of <slice> and <intent> blocks are executed in order of declaration. only the first block matching all the requirements for a given user query executes..&& you need to grant slice access permission to google assistant on startup. slice permissions are hierarchical.&& so assistant would get permission to all slice uris as long as you grant permission to assistant on a top-level uri (for example: content://com.foo.slice.provider/)..&& the following code snippet shows how you might implement this:.&& in order to trigger app actions.&& google logs the following data about your slice (specifically from the slicemetadata object):.&& we explicitly do not log the following slicemetadata information:.&& as a result.&& no information is available from google assistant on user selections within the context of a provided slice..&& this section highlights key requirements and best practices when you integrate app actions with slices..&& except as otherwise noted.&& the

app actions, guides, implement an android slice by following the steps described in the slices getting started guide., in the shortcuts.xml file, add a <slice> element to your capability. within the <slice> element, add <url-template> and <parameter> tags for the capability., iserrorslice(), ispermissionslice(), getloadingstate(), gettitle(), getsubtitle(), getsummary(), getslicekeywords(), make sure you define a primary action for each slice., while loading the content of the slice, make sure to set the isloading field in the slices api to true if the slice being returned is a loading slice (and false otherwise)., to indicate error conditions, use the setiserror() method to let google know that slice content was not loaded successfully or that the users request could not be handled., (required) do not show ads in your slices., (required) do not add header or footer information in your slices; google automatically provides this., slice content should be completely focused on fulfilling the intent—dont try to fulfill multiple intents with one slice or add irrelevant content., (required) where user authentication is needed to complete a user flow, return a slice that explains that the user needs to continue in the app. in-line user authentication in google assistant is not supported for app actions., if users are permitting your app to show data via slices, you can return an error slice at runtime for unauthorized users., (required) deep-link the user to the correct screen in your app, not the home screen., (required) in your shortcuts.xml, always provide fallback deep link fulfillment in addition to slice fulfillment for a given built-in intent. the exception to this is where no parameter mappings are defined for that app action, in which case only the slice fulfillment is needed., more information google assistant why build for the assistant? how google assistant works assistant directory support community, google assistant, why build for the
