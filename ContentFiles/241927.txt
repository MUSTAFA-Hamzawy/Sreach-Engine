[reviews.&& contributor.&& as a staple crop for nearly half the world’s population.&& rice is one of the planet’s most versatile.&& ubiquitous grains. present in just about every cuisine and culture from east to west.&& rice serves as the basis for a wide range of national specialties.&& comfort foods.&& and everyday meals. it comes as little surprise that modern technology has made it easier to make a perfect batch of rice without taking your stockpot to the stovetop in order to get fluffy grains for breakfast.&& lunch.&& or dinner. .&& “my mom has had the same rice cooker for 40 years.&&” says tim ma.&& chef of d.c. restaurant lucky danger. “that durability is the real testament to a good.&& reliable rice cooker.&& which is more important than any modern bells or whistles.” for rice cookers that will withstand the test of time.&& experts say that you ought to look for a few things..&& “the first thing i look for in a rice cooker is capacity.&&” says james beard award semifinalist kevin tien of d.c.’s moon rabbit. while most home cooks won’t need commercial capacity.&& having an appliance that can handle several servings of rice at a time makes for a much more desirable machine. “i also much prefer lids that snap close.&& rather than glass lids that lift off.&&” tien continues. “the snap lid normally has the metal plate on top for a more even heat distribution for cooking rice.&& and it seals better for an even cook too.&&” he explains. .&& you’ll also want a rice cooker with a nonstick interior for easier cleanup.&& and tien recommends rice cookers that use induction heating. “these machines cook rice more evenly and won’t burn the bottom.” and finally.&& be sure that your rice cooker has a holding function that keeps your rice warm once it’s finished cooking. .&& to help you find the best rice cooker for your kitchen.&& we’ve rounded up our favorite models. .&& the tiger rice cooker won us over with its simplicity. the one-touch settings are plain rice.&& brown rice.&& slow cooking.&& or syncro-cooking.&& which lets you simultaneously cook rice and steam a main dish (while keeping them separated.&& so there’s no commingling of flavors). the interior is nonstick.&& and it includes a nonstick spatula.&& a measuring cup for rice.&& and a cookbook with suggestions for the synchrony function. there is no timer or alarm to alert you when the device switches from cooking to warming.&& so you do have to keep an eye on it. luckily.&& it’s pretty fast—one cup of rice cooked in just over 20 minutes..&& this wall mountable japanese-made rice cooker comes from one of the best-known brands. it cooks rice to your preferred doneness.&& with options for “softer” or “harder.” it features “neuro fuzzy logic” technology.&& so the machine uses a thermal sensor to decide on time and temperature based on grain choice.&& weight.&& and moisture level. there are many grain options pre-set.&& including regular or sushi rice.&& brown rice.&& porridge.&& and mixed. there is an extended keep-warm function (up to 12 hours) and a reheat cycle. the interior is nonstick.&& and it comes with lots of accessories. we liked the retractable cord and well-balanced handles..&& the toshiba rice cooker features seven pre-programmed cooking options: white rice.&& brown rice.&& mixed rice.&& short-grain.&& long-grain.&& oatmeal.&& and porridge. there is a quick rice setting to churn out finished batches of rice in 30 minutes.&& and it also has two programmable delay start options.&& which means that you can fill it in the morning and have it ready at dinner. the keep-warm setting lasts a full 24 hours. like the zojirushi.&& this model uses fuzzy logic technology for adaptive cooking..&& instant pot’s specially designed rice cooker offers four settings: white rice.&& brown rice.&& quinoa.&& and oatmeal. this one cooks quickly.&& with a batch of white rice being ready in about 20 minutes. there is a steamer tray.&& and the dishwasher-safe nonstick ceramic-coated interior pot offers added heat retention. there is no alarm to alert you when cooking has finished.&& but the unit will automatically switch to warm.&& and that function lasts up to 12 hours..&& the dash mini rice cooker has a small footprint to go with its small capacity. we found that this cooker produced well-cooked rice in less than 20 minutes (though there was some trial and error figuring out the proper water to rice ratio on this one.&& because of its diminutive size). the settings are simple: cook and warm. the manufacturer suggests using this to also make oatmeal.&& quinoa.&& pasta.&& soups.&& and stews. .&& the aroma housewares rice cooker offers six functions: white rice.&& brown rice.&& steam.&& keep warm.&& delay (up to 15 hours).&& and flash (which purports to reduce cooking time by 50 percent). there are instructions for cooking other grains using the white and brown rice settings.&& i.e..&& to make quinoa.&& follow the white rice instructions and press that setting. the unit beeps and automatically switches to warm when cooking is completed. the lightweight nonstick interior pot is made of bonded granite and is dishwasher safe. it includes a steamer tray to cook vegetables or proteins above your rice.&& a measuring cup.&& and a spatula.][why you need a rice cooker in your kitchen, buying guide, our picks, tiger micom
