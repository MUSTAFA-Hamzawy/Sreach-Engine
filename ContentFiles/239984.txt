[having helmed some of the most successful films of hollywood’s golden age.&& winning an academy award and receiving a further three official nominations in the process.&& it may seem inconsistent to consider michael curtiz an underrated director. yet he was seldom afforded the degree of respect and singular appreciation granted to more celebrated colleagues.&& particularly those classified as “auteurs.&&” with their work analysed and applauded for repeated themes.&& narrative fields.&& and distinct stylistic inclinations. still.&& there’s no question curtiz was suitably recognized in his day.&& among his peers if not contemporary critics.&& and audiences.&& even if they didn’t instantly identify his name.&& were routinely drawn to his latest release. although curtiz’s stature did improve as years passed.&& partly due to the enduring reputation of his most admired films.&& biographer alan k. rode notes that while “many of curtiz’s credits were venerated by succeeding

curtiz.&& a classically trained actor.&& “virtually invented the film industry in his native hungary.&&” 2 overcoming an impoverished upbringing and little formal training to eventually manage several

having worked in an assortment of genres and for a handful of different studios. only his time as an artillery officer in the austro-hungarian army.&& in 1914.&& seemed to curb his insatiable enthusiasm and divert his attentions from the film industry. having changed his name to mihály kertész in order to avoid negative associations with his jewish heritage.&& curtiz continued to digest

commitment to personal vision. among his early achievements.&& which included social dramas and adaptations of popular texts.&& sodom und gomorrha (sodom and gomorrah.&& 1922) is a particularly

to absorb u.s. history and culture would be reflected in the sensibility as well as the reality of his work.” 4 furthermore.&& even if the stories were less than novel.&& curtiz displayed a canny knack for resourceful.&& expressive stylization.&& and as time went on.&& he demonstrated a shrewd ability to master the industry’s shifting technological advancements.&& from sound (tenderloin.&& an early vitaphone effort in 1928).&& to colour (1930’s under a texas moon.&& the earliest surviving warner bros. film shot entirely in technicolor).&& to.&& years later.&& widescreen (1954’s the

was also able to expand his range.&& directing a sundry selection of films and working with some of the era’s most famous stars. he tried his hand at minor musical numbers for the 1929 al jolson picture.&& hearts in exile; he directed the renowned john barrymore in the mad genius (1931); and he introduced to american audiences the german import lil dagover in 1932’s the woman from monte carlo (with mediocre results). he also directed frank fay in such films as the matrimonial bed (1930) and god’s gift to women (1931).&& two breezy situational comedies that revel in the eccentric behaviour of their frivolous.&& sometimes audacious characters.&& and he directed richard barthelmess in 1932’s cabin in the cotton.&& which was bette davis’s debut feature and the first of seven she made with curtiz (another early outing with davis was 20.&&000 years in sing sing.&& a stark and robust prison picture about honour and obligation.&& also released in 1932 with spencer tracy in the lead)..&& these films are emblematic of curtiz’s durable ability to mix genres and manifold subject matter.&& and they exhibit his innate gift for camera mobility—notably in enclosed spaces—as well as his penchant for subtle moral quandaries and intense tonal accents. although they were “mostly conventional endeavours.&& thanks to the depression.&&” 6 curtiz was essentially “assigned a new film roughly every two months.&&” 7 regularly returning to warners’s stable of stars. william powell appeared in two of curtiz’s sprightly murder mysteries.&& private detective 62 and the kennel murder case.&& both released in 1933 and highlighted by fluid camera work and knotty criminal scenarios. the keyhole (1933) was the first of six curtiz films to feature george brent and was a showcase for kay francis.&& who one year later excelled in the sexually suggestive mandalay.&& “an excellent example of curtiz’s ability to rise above humdrum material and.&& against studio resistance.&& bestow upon it a distinction it would not otherwise possess.” 8 that same year.&& curtiz also worked with james cagney for the first time on the fast-paced jimmy the gent.&& with its occasionally dark humour and

productions like alias the doctor (1932).&& a remake of the charlatan.&& which curtiz directed in hungary in 1917 and 1923 (then as nameless).&& and his rare ventures into the horror genre procured the stunning production design of anton grot to augment evocative productions like doctor x (1932) and mystery of the wax museum (1933).&& the latter dubbed an “artistic tour de force” by rode. 9 curtiz also proved at home in realms of elegance.&& diplomatic formality.&& and political volatility.&& as in the revolution romance british agent (1934).&& and his rendering of blue-collar hardship in black fury (1935) was bolstered by second unit footage captured near the coalfields of pittsburgh.&& pennsylvania. starring paul muni in a committed performance.&& this film.&& with its gritty compositions and sensitive subject matter.&& was a “defining film for curtiz” 10 and reveals the director’s attuned sensibilities when it came to depression-era privations and working-class divisions. .&& mandalay.&& mystery of the wax museum.&& such socially conscious fare was a staple for warner bros. in the 1930s.&& and curtiz was often front and centre in an effort to further the cultural consciousness when it came to sexual morality.&& as in front page woman (1935).&& with davis as a clever and determined female reporter.&& and judicial reckoning.&& as in mountain justice (1937).&& based on a controversial murder case and demonstrating curtiz’s material sincerity and his trademark quest for accuracy. gangster films similarly aligned with a warner bros. preference for “ripped-from-the-headlines” scenarios and.&& in rode’s opinion.&& if there is “a single film emblematic of the warner bros. style that emerged from the depression.&& kid galahad [1937] may be it.” 11 starring davis.&& humphrey bogart.&& and edward g. robinson.&& this film’s visual agility and combative tension make it a thrilling precursor to angels with dirty faces (1938).&& another bustling urban drama defined by wise guy banter.&& dynamic imagery.&& and ethical juxtapositions.&& in this case between the divergent paths of cagney’s lifelong hood and pat o’brien’s reformed priest. .&& at

numerous individuals within a single frame.&& only now.&& the illustrative practice is relocated to a cultivated domestic milieu.&& a lively household bursting with homespun charm and comedic romance. the central stars of four daughters later appeared in three additional films.&& including a virtual remake.&& daughters courageous (1939).&& a more direct sequel.&& four wives (1939).&& and four mothers (1941).&& the only one of the set not directed by curtiz. idyllic american small-towns containing the precocious.&& precarious lives and loves of spirited siblings and families became fertile ground for curtiz.&& and he would return to similar settings in films such as jamie (1944).&& a blithe tale of teenage romantic trifles. four daughters was also significant as the first film for which curtiz received an official oscar nomination.&& splitting the vote in 1939 with angels with dirty faces.&& for which he was also nominated (he had earlier received a write-in nod for 1935’s captain

honeymoon.&& directing ten scenes total.&& and black legion (1937).&& a powerful bogart film about anti-immigrant sentiment.&& which curtiz stepped in to direct after archie mayo was removed from the picture. in the words of william dieterle.&& another dependable warner bros. director.&& if someone “wasn’t fast enough or gave them too much trouble.&& [the studio] replaced him.&& usually with michael [curtiz]. mike did everything. he could finish a picture at 11 and at 1 p.m. start a new picture.” 12 curtiz was especially quick to assist if the graciousness granted him leeway on his own projects.&& as when he finished directing anthony adverse (1936) in order to make the charge of the light brigade (1936).&& a rousing adventure distinguished by its impeccable formal compositions.&& inspired action sequences.&& and liberal historical veracity. in any and all cases.&& despite the less-promising material sometimes sent his way.&& curtiz “never gave second-hand treatment to an assignment once it was accepted.” according to author william meyer.&& the workaholic director “went ahead and graced plot and character with fluid camera movement.&& exquisite lighting.&& and a lightning-fast pace. even if a script was truly poor and the leading players were real amateurs.&& curtiz glossed over inadequacies so well that an audience often failed to recognize a shallow substance until it was hungry for another film a half-hour later.” 13.&& “curtiz’s ability to take charge of any film with virtually no advance preparation had become a notable strength.&&” remarks rode. “he continued to be rushed into the breach whenever something had to be done in a pinch.” 14 arguably the most fruitful example of this was when curtiz took over 1938’s the adventures of robin hood after unsuccessful preliminary shooting by william keighley. aside from its dazzling technicolor cinematography.&& its stimulating pace.&& and its infectiously jovial humour.&& this well-liked classic showcases the best of errol flynn’s dashing charisma. curtiz frequently paid favour to underdogs and rebellious outsiders.&& and flynn’s titular hero.&& dubbed “saucy” and a “bold rascal” by claude rains’ adversarial antagonist prince john.&& is a sensational case in point. the film was a tremendous success at the box office and garnered four academy award nominations. it also helped cement flynn as a major star.&& a position owed to curtiz as much as anyone..&& flynn had first worked with curtiz on the case of the curious bride (1935).&& where the actor merely played a corpse in what rode considers the “most entertaining of warner’s six perry mason films.” 15 but a more proper starring role came in captain blood.&& a decorative adventure where flynn’s casual appeal so improved over the course of filming that curtiz conducted reshoots of earlier scenes to capitalize on the actor’s increased ability. the film is also a platform for curtiz’s masterful use of light and

newspaper comedy starring flynn and frequent co-star olivia de havilland.&& and dodge city (1939).&& a raucous western about the modernizing and expansion of westward civilization. flynn then appeared

during most of his stint at warner bros..&& curtiz was regularly in close though combative communication with studio production chief hal b. wallis.&& who would regularly chide the director for what
