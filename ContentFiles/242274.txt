[when a massive longship was unearthed in norway more than 100 years ago.&& its occupants were expected to be powerful men. instead.&& the richest grave site of viking age belonged to two women.&& whose identities remain unknown..&& vikings are often depicted as warmongering seafarers from scandinavia.&& men who set out on expeditions to plunder distant lands. the lives of women of the viking age factor less into the fantasy; many imagine them at home.&& tending to their lands.&& children.&& and elderly while the powerful men in their family were away. but evidence shows viking women also held positions of power. .&& in fact.&& the grandest single viking grave ever found belonged not to a man.&& but to two women—one about 75 years of age.&& the other around 50—who were buried in a funerary longship on the oseberg farm near tønsberg.&& norway. their burial was one of historys most exciting viking-era discoveries..&& (after pillaging france and spain.&& viking raiders set their sights on rome.).&& it is not clear who the two oseberg women were in life. what is known is that they died in a.d. 834 and were sent to the afterlife with a magnificent burial. experts believe the older one probably died of cancer.&& while the cause of death for the younger one could not be determined..&& given the riches that accompanied them.&& they must have been important figures in viking society. perhaps they were political or religious leaders. some archaeologists think the older woman was a viking queen who ruled in her own right and was buried with a servant or attendant. she might even be queen åsa.&& the grandmother of harald i (a.d. 860–940).&& the first king of united norway. others suggest she was a powerful sorceress. .&& some scholars believe one of the women was sacrificed to accompany the higher-ranking on her journey into the afterlife. theyre just not certain who was the women of higher rank. .&& (scientists raid dna to explore vikings’ genetic roots.).&& whoever these women were.&& the treasures they left behind are stunning.while most vikings were buried in graves with favorite belongings (sometimes including their dogs).&& the wealthiest were taken to the next world in ships.&& crammed with clothes.&& weapons.&& even furniture. these ships could take many different forms. some viking mourners burned funerary boats.&& others commemorated the departed by raising stone monuments in the shape of ships. and in the upper classes.&& some families buried their dead in rowboats.&& coastal vessels.&& or seagoing longships like the two women in the oseberg ship..&& (this mass grave may belong to the great viking army.).&& among the items scattered within the burial site was an intricately carved cart by an ancient woodworker.&& the only such discovery thus far from the viking age. it would have been suitable for ceremonial processions. one carved scene may portray the saga hero gunnar in a snake pit..&& archaeologists have found boat burials across the viking world.&& from the shetland islands north of scotland to viking settlements in russia. often mourners seem to have conducted elaborate ritual performances during funerals—feasting and drinking for days.&& hurling weapons into the boats.&& and slaughtering horses and even humans to accompany the dead. when the rituals were finally over.&& both the boat and its human cargo were consigned to the earth.&& buried beneath a mound..&& (ancient solar storm pinpoints viking settlement in americas exactly 1.&&000 years ago.).&& in the case of the oseberg women.&& a farmer discovered their ship.&& made almost entirely of oak.&& in 1903 in a large burial mound at his farm near tønsberg.&& norway..&& copyright © 1996-2015 national geographic societycopyright ©
