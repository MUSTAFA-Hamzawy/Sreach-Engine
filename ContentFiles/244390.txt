(his group promotes a bitcoin spinoff.&& bitcoin sv.&& that sees itself as a more useful version of the cryptocurrency.).&& bitcoin is doomed.&& mr. nguyen argues.&& because it can be slow and expensive to process transactions.&& making it less useful for paying for things. “and so a lot of bitcoin supporters have had to come up with this argument that it’s meant to be a reserve asset.&&” he said..&& kevin werbach.&& a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania.&& floated a different theory. bitcoin’s earliest and most vocal adopters.&& he said.&& tended to be libertarians who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of insurance policy against hyperinflation and government corruption. but the more recent price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments.&& and cared less about their political implications..&& “there’s a tremendous amount of rhetoric around bitcoin in particular that suggests that it’s predominantly a means of escaping from the government-issued fiat currency system.&&” he said. “and yet most of the activity.&& according to basically every rigorous study that’s been done.&& is predominantly people speculating.”.&& in mariupol. the bloodiest battle of the war in ukraine ended in mariupol.&& as the ukrainian military ordered fighters holed up at a steel plant in the city to surrender. russia said that nearly 1.&&000 ukrainian fighters are in kremlin custody.&& though their fate remains uncertain..&& war crimes trial. a russian soldier pleaded guilty in a kyiv court to having shot a civilian. this is the first trial ukraine has conducted for an act that could be considered a war crime since russia launched its invasion..&& nato’s expansion. finland and sweden formally asked to join nato.&& in potentially the alliance’s biggest expansion in two decades. but turkey.&& a nato member.&& blocked an initial effort to move ahead quickly with their applications.&& according to a senior diplomat..&& another possible explanation for bitcoin’s underperformance.&& which was floated by joe weisenthal at bloomberg.&& is that chaos cuts both ways.&& and that the same events that could be seen as “good for bitcoin” in the short term — inflation.&& sanctions.&& geopolitical conflict — could also be bad for bitcoin over the long term.&& since they could draw the attention of regulators..&& “to whatever extent the canadian trucker story would be seen as bullish for bitcoin (because it got people thinking about ways of making payments without regulated entities) it’s also bearish for bitcoin (because it caught the attention of state actors who wanted to push back against such payments).&&” he wrote..&& there are other explanations out there.&& too. sam bankman-fried.&& the chief executive of crypto exchange ftx.&& said on twitter that while he thought bitcoin would “do better” in a less stable political and economic environment.&& he guessed that the discrepancy was partially related to the media’s negative coverage of crypto..&& “headlines have been largely negative independent of actual content the last month in a reaction to statements from the industry.&& which i think has posed significant headwinds.&&” he wrote..&& but perhaps the most interesting view of crypto’s usefulness during unstable times comes straight from ukraine’s government..&& on tuesday.&& i posed a question about crypto to alex bornyakov.&& ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. since the russian invasion.&& mr. bornyakov and his team — led by the country’s digital minister.&& mykhailo fedorov — have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for ukraine’s army. tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin.&& ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses.&& and the money has been used to buy military supplies.&& including bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles..&& mr. bornyakov.&& who was speaking from an undisclosed location in ukraine on a video conference hosted by the artificial intelligence company collective[i].&& said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed..&& “in a situation like this.&& where the national bank is not fully operating.&& crypto is helping to perform fast transfers.&& to make it very quick and get results almost immediately.&&” he said..&& but mr. bornyakov seemed wary of overstating crypto’s importance to the ukrainian cause..&& “i don’t think crypto is playing a major part.&&” mr. bornyakov said. “but its role is essential in this conflict in terms of helping our army.”.&& advertisement][russia-ukraine war, bitcoin was made for this moment. so why isn’t it booming?, live updates: russia-ukraine war, russia-ukraine war: key developments, site information navigation]bitcoin’s value drops amid russia-ukraine war and inflation -
