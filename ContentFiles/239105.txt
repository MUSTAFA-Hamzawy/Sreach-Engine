[users on android phones can ask google assistant to share app content with another user using a voice command like hey google.&& send this to jane. based on the first users system options.&& assistant may then incorporate text from the screen or a device screenshot in the shared content..&& this method of sharing is often sufficient.&& but users who receive content shared from your app might not re-enter the app to view content. you can provide assistant with structured information about the current foreground content by implementing the onprovideassistcontent() method..&& this process helps maintain the structure of data as its shared to another user. users who receive shared app content can then be deep linked or receive content directly.&& instead of as text or as a screenshot..&& we recommend you implement onprovideassistcontent() for any sharable entity in your app..&& you only need to implement onprovideassistcontent() for the final app activity in the users task flow after invoking the app action. for example.&& in a create_money_transfer flow.&& you would implement the method in the final screen showing the receipt; you wouldnt need to implement it for any in-progress or preview screens..&& provide contextual information as a json-ld object using schema.org vocabulary in the structureddata field of assistcontent. the following code snippet shows an example of logging contextual content:.&& although we recommend providing as much data as possible about each entity.&& we require the following fields:.&& to learn more about using onprovideassistcontent().&& see the optimizing contextual content for the assistant guide in the android developer documentation..&& except as otherwise noted.&& the content of this page is licensed under the creative commons attribution 4.0 license.&& and code samples are licensed under the apache 2.0 license. for details.&& see the google developers site policies. java is a registered trademark of oracle and/or its affiliates..&& last updated 2022-05-17 utc.][assistant sharing, providing content to assistant, more information, programs, developer consoles]assistant sharing  |  app actions  |  google developers[][google assistant, ways to build, overview learn all the ways to build actions., extend your mobile app provide faster ways for users to access your android app via assistant., build rich and natural conversations build custom voice and visual experiences for smart devices., enhance your web presence present your content in rich ways for google search and assistant., connect your smart home devices let users control lights, doors, coffee machines, and many other devices., get inspired, why build help users find answers and get things done with google assistant., reach 1 billion devices help users at home, on the go, and in the car—on over 1 billion devices., build games build fun, voice-enabled games for smart displays., explore all actions see what others are building for google assistant., get discovered publish your actions to the assistant directory., mobile, app actions, android slices, assistant sharing, read it, content, schema.org web markup, smart home devices, overview, device types and traits, local home sdk, experimental devices, assistant sdk, conversational, overview, fundamentals, build, interactive canvas, user engagement, transactions, account linking, console, overview, localization, analytics, policies, go to console, app actions, google assistant, actions on google more, more, docs more guides reference codelabs samples support, more, guides, reference, codelabs, samples, support, community, support, design, overview, build, overview, implement built-in intents, create shortcuts.xml, push dynamic shortcuts to assistant, release notes, test, google assistant plugin, grow, overview, in-app shortcut promo sdk, add more features, custom intents, android widgets, foreground app invocation, inline inventory, web inventory, assistant sharing, android slices, read it, actions.xml, actions.xml overview, build app actions, create actions.xml, web inventory, app actions test tool, troubleshooting, actions.xml migration guide, ways to build, overview, extend your mobile app, build rich and natural conversations, enhance your web presence, connect your smart home devices, get inspired, why build, reach 1 billion devices, build games, explore all actions, get discovered, mobile, app actions, android slices, assistant sharing, read it, content, schema.org web markup, smart home devices, overview, device types and traits, local home sdk, experimental devices, assistant sdk, conversational, overview, fundamentals, build, interactive canvas, user engagement, transactions, account linking, console, overview, localization, analytics, policies, go to console, home, products, google assistant, docs, app actions, guides, @type, .name, .url (only required if the content is url-addressable), more information google assistant why build for the assistant?
