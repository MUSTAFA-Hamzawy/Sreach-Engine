[geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the forms, angles, measurements, and proportions of ordinary objects. there are two-dimensional forms and three-dimensional shapes in euclidean geometry. flat shapes are two shapes in plane geometry that include triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. 3d forms such as a square, cuboid, cone, and so on are also known as solids in solid geometry. the fundamental geometry is based on points, lines, and planes, as described in coordinate geometry., , the various forms of shapes in geometry help us understand the shapes we see in our daily lives. we can measure the field, circumference, and volume of shapes using geometric principles., plane geometry is concerned with platforms that can be drawn on paper. lines, circles, and triangles in two dimensions are examples. plane geometry is another name for two-dimensional geometry. all two-dimensional figures have only two dimensions: length and width. it does not take into account the depth of the shapes. plane figures have squares, triangles, rectangles, circles, and so on. any of the most essential terms in plane geometry are described here in the below articles:, solid geometry is concerned with three-dimensional structures such as cubes, prisms, cylinders, and spheres. it is concerned with the figureâ€™s three dimensions, which are length, width, and height. however, certain solids do not have faces (e.g. sphere). the analysis of three dimensions in euclidean space is known as solid geometry. the structures of our environment are three-dimensional. both three-dimensional shapes are created by rotating two-dimensional shapes. faces, corners, and vertices are essential characteristics of 3d forms. examine these words in depth for various geometric forms here in the following articles:, writing code in comment? please use ide.geeksforgeeks.org, generate link and share the link here.][related articles, table of contents, geometry, table of
