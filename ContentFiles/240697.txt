[by imogen foulkes bbc news.&& geneva.&& in 1949.&& following the horrors of the second world war.&& world leaders gathered in switzerland to sign the geneva conventions..&& 196 countries have ratified them.&& no other international treaty has received such broad support..&& these were the rules which were supposed to limit the savagery of war.&& to protect humanity from another auschwitz.&& siege of leningrad.&& or dresden firestorm..&& it was an exciting time. the united nations had been created and the universal declaration on human rights had been drafted..&& so heady was the mood for peace that the swiss government.&& which had invited countries to geneva to sign up to the conventions.&& had to reassure arriving heads of state that while of course the long-term goal was to end war altogether.&& in the meantime some rules were a good idea..&& so how are the geneva conventions doing today? not very well.&& according to their guardian.&& the international committee of the red cross (icrc)..&& in conflicts from syria.&& to yemen.&& to mali.&& ivory coast.&& iraq.&& or afghanistan.&& war tactics include siege.&& attacks on hospitals.&& sexual violence and the arbitrary execution of detainees..&& it all adds up.&& says icrc president peter maurer.&& to a shattering of the system of the geneva conventions..&& so.&& this week in geneva.&& the 196 countries which signed the conventions will meet at the international red cross conference to discuss how to fix them..&& joanne liu.&& president of the medical charity medecins sans frontieres.&& will be listening carefully..&& when msfs hospital in the afghan city of kunduz was bombed in october.&& ms liu felt astonishment and outrage..&& as the fighting in kunduz intensified.&& she had reassured her staff that the conventions prohibiting attacks on medical facilities would protect them: us and afghan forces knew exactly where the hospital was..&& i told my staff our hospital was the safest place to be.&& she remembers..&& but on the night of 3 october.&& 30 people.&& among them 13 msf staff.&& were killed in a bomb attack lasting an hour..&& and although the us says the bombing was a mistake.&& joanne liu wants clarification about how committed states really are to the geneva conventions..&& describing the conventions as providing all the essentials needed to bring humanity in a conflict.&& ms liu believes that we would be fine as long as they were respected..&& but.&& some people question whether the conventions really apply to modern warfare..&& they were written with traditional battlefields and traditional armies in mind..&& but where are the battlefields today? at aleppos water supply station? in a concert hall in paris?.&& and who are the armies to whom the conventions apply - so-called islamic state (is).&& the syrian army.&& the us airforce?.&& david rodin.&& a moral philosopher and co-director of the oxford institute for ethics.&& law and armed conflict.&& points out that if you look historically at where the law of armed conflict came from.&& its about mutually advantageous reciprocity.&& its in the interests of both to have some restraint..&& he adds: so what do you do when you have a foe who is not interested in that reciprocity? theres no benefit to us in behaving well if the enemy doesnt..&& this might be a seductive line of argument for countries engaged in the so-called war on terror..&& back in 2002.&& the bush administration suggested the geneva conventions on prisoners of war would not apply to those captured and taken to guantanamo bay..&& mr rodin.&& however.&& cautions against such thinking.&& saying: there are things we owe to people simply because we are human beings and we owe them that even if they dont recognise those obligations mutually..&& such ideals led to the geneva conventions in the first place and to much of our human rights law - the convention against torture and the convention against racial discrimination..&& but not much visionary international law has been drafted recently and it is no coincidence that three of the five permanent members of the un security council (the us.&& russia and china) have not ratified the international criminal court..&& states seem increasingly reluctant to adopt international treaties which might impinge on their own national policy..&& the geneva conventions are founded on just a few basic principles:.&& medical staff and hospitals in warzones must be protected and allowed to work freely..&& those wounded in battle and no longer fighting are entitled to medical treatment..&& prisoners of war must be treated humanely..&& warring parties are obliged to protect civilians (this includes a prohibition on the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as power and water supplies)..&& geneva conventions.&& marco sassoli.&& professor of law at geneva university.&& believes the current climate is not conducive..&& today.&& and this is a bad sign for our international society.&& states would never adopt such protective and detailed conventions as the 1949 conventions..&& professor sassoli believes even trying to modernise the conventions could be a catastrophe.&& warning that opening them up might end up weakening rather than strengthening them..&& and so member states meeting in geneva this week will discuss something much more modest: a proposal.&& drafted by switzerland and the icrc.&& for a forum in which states can discuss the challenges and issues relating to the conventions..&& in the hope of getting everyone on board.&& the forum will not deal with specific countries or specific situations.&& explains swiss diplomat francois voeffray.&& who added that some countries were concerned by the risk of politicisation..&& it sounds like a vague talking shop.&& but if it succeeds it will put all 196 signatory countries.&& from syria.&& to saudi arabia.&& to yemen.&& russia.&& or the us.&& in the same room to discuss how to honour the rules to which they have signed up..&& helen durham.&& chief legal officer with the international committee of the red cross.&& believes it could be the start of a very necessary debate - not about whether the conventions are still relevant.&& but on how to strengthen respect for laws which she believes are more precious than ever..&& within times of armed conflict there is a space for humanity.&& she insists..&& we have to have laws that find (that) place for humanity and limit suffering. you dont throw out a good law because it is difficult to implement..&& air strike kills afghan medical staff.&& rules and conventions of war.&& nearly 1.&&000 fighters have left mariupol steelworks -
