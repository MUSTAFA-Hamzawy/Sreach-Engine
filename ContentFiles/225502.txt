speech recognition (asr), dialogue management, natural language processing (nlp), natural-language understanding (nlu), text-to-speech (tts), fpi: failure point isolation in large-scale conversational assistants rinat khaziev, usman shahid, tobias röding, rakesh chada, emir kapanci, pradeep natarajan naacl 2022 2022 large-scale conversational assistants such as cortana, alexa, google assistant and siri process requests through a series of modules for wake word detection, speech recognition, language understanding and response generation. an error in one of these modules can cascade through the system. given the large traffic volumes in these assistants, it is infeasible to manually analyze the data, identify requests conversational ai / natural-language processing, product answer generation from heterogeneous sources: a new benchmark and best practices xiaoyu shen, gianni barlacchi, marco del tredici, weiwei cheng, adria de gispert, bill byrne acl 2022 ecnlp workshop 2022 it is of great value to answer product questions based on heterogeneous information sources available on web product pages, e.g., semistructured attributes, text descriptions, user-provided contents, etc. however, these sources have different structures and writing styles, which poses challenges for (1) evidence ranking, (2) source selection, and (3) answer generation. in this paper, we build a benchmark conversational ai / natural-language processing, answer consolidation: formulation and benchmarking wenxuan zhou, qiang ning, heba elfardy, kevin small, muhao chen naacl 2022 2022 current question answering (qa) systems primarily consider the single-answer scenario, where each question is assumed to be paired with one correct answer. however, in many real-world qa applications, multiple answer scenarios arise where consolidating answers into a comprehensive and non-redundant set of answers is a more efficient user interface. in this paper, we formulate the problem of answer consolidation conversational ai / natural-language processing, paragraph-based transformer pre-training for multi-sentence inference luca di liello, siddhant garg, luca soldaini, alessandro moschitti naacl 2022 2022 inference tasks such as answer sentence selection (as2) or fact verification are typically solved by fine-tuning transformer-based models as individual sentence-pair classifiers. recent studies show that these tasks benefit from modeling dependencies across multiple candidate sentences jointly. in this paper, we first show that popular pre-trained transformers perform poorly when used for fine-tuning on conversational ai / natural-language processing, contrastive representation learning for cross-document coreference resolution of events and entities benjamin hsu, graham horwood naacl 2022 2022 identifying related entities and events within and across documents is fundamental to natural language understanding. we present an approach to entity and event coreference resolution utilizing contrastive representation learning. earlier state-of-the-art methods have formulated this problem as a binary classification problem and leveraged large transformers in a cross-encoder architecture to achieve their conversational ai / natural-language processing, the science behind ultrasonic motion sensing for echo krishna kamath may 04, 2022 reducing false positives for rare events, adapting echo hardware to ultrasound sensing, and enabling concurrent ultrasound sensing and music playback are just a few challenges amazon researchers addressed. conversational ai /
