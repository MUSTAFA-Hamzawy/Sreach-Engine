best practices xiaoyu shen, gianni barlacchi, marco del tredici, weiwei cheng, adria de gispert, bill byrne acl 2022 ecnlp workshop 2022 it is of great value to answer product questions based on heterogeneous information sources available on web product pages, e.g., semistructured attributes, text descriptions, user-provided contents, etc. however, these sources have different structures and writing styles, which poses challenges for (1) evidence ranking, (2) source selection, and (3) answer generation. in this paper, we build a benchmark conversational ai / natural-language processing, question rewriting for open-domain conversational qa: best practices and limitations marco del tredici, gianni barlacchi, xiaoyu shen, weiwei cheng, adria de gispert cikm 2021 2021 open-domain conversational qa (odcqa) calls for effective question rewriting (qr), as the questions in a conversation typically lack proper context for the qa model to interpret. in this paper, we compare two types of qr approaches, generative and expansive qr, in end-to-end odcqa systems with recently released qrecc and or-quac benchmarks. while it is common practice to apply the same qr approach for both conversational ai / natural-language processing, multiplicative tree-structured long short-term memory networks for semantic representations nam khanh tran, weiwei cheng naacl 2018 2018 tree-structured lstms have shown advantages in learning semantic representations by exploiting syntactic information. most existing methods model tree structures by bottomup combinations of constituent nodes using the same shared compositional function and often making use of input word information only. the inability to capture the richness of compositionality makes these models lack expressive power. conversational ai / natural-language processing, salience rank: efficient keyphrase extraction with topic modeling nedelina teneva, weiwei cheng acl 2017 2017 topical pagerank (tpr) uses latent topic distribution inferred by latent dirichlet allocation (lda) to perform ranking of noun phrases extracted from documents. the ranking procedure consists of running pagerank k times, where k is the number of topics used in the lda model. in this paper, we propose a modification of tpr, called salience rank. salience rank only needs to run pagerank once and extracts conversational
