[reviews / wellness.&& ↳ get the conair sound therapy machine from amazon for $49.99..&& i come from a family of very heavy snorers.&& and i have the unfortunate gift of supersonic hearing.&& which led to some torturous nights growing up. after college.&& my husband and i rented a gorgeous apartment right next to the red line in chicago.&& where the frequently passing elevated trains were so loud that we’d have to wear earplugs to sleep. and.&& even without a racing train nearby.&& there are a plethora of household sounds that can keep a light sleeper awake: the intermittent hum of a radiator.&& a neighbor’s dog barking.&& a partner watching tiktok videos in bed (that one’s me)..&& my best trick to drowning out the snoring and background noise? playing ambient music on a timer until i can at last settle into sleep. combating disruptive sound with more sound—what a concept. but that is.&& after all.&& the purpose of a sound machine..&& when our baby was born.&& the literature said to create a “womblike environment” for newborns to ease them into the world.&& which included swaddling.&& light-blocking curtains.&& and steady and consistent sound. for a while.&& we’d take our colicky kid into the bathroom.&& where the vent provided a loud hum that lulled her into a calmer state. but there’s only so long you can sit on a closed toilet seat rocking your baby. i also spent many hours shushing into her ear.&& which in retrospect seems ridiculous. (they now make electronic baby shushers for just that purpose.) she was sensitive to noise.&& often jolting awake at every cringe-inducing creak of the stairs. i remember glaring at my husband every time he’d go to the ice machine in the freezer. “just drink it lukewarm.&&” i’d hiss. once.&& my mother-in-law shoved a whole basket of uneaten french fries down our ancient dishwasher disposal during my daughter’s nap. i don’t think i ever recovered from that one..&& our friend and much more relaxed parent-in-arms told us that he circumvented the noise sensitivity in his three kids by strapping them to his back while vacuuming the house during their naps. “exposure therapy. they just learned to deal with it.&&” he said.&& shrugging. .&& no such luck for our little one..&& when our baby was born.&& the literature said to create a “womblike environment” for newborns to ease them into the world.&& which included swaddling.&& light-blocking curtains.&& and steady and consistent sound..&& once our daughter moved from her bassinet in our room to her own nursery.&& we decided to invest in a sound machine—the conair sound therapy machine.&& to be exact. it was a game-changer..&& when you’re looking for a sound machine for kids.&& you want to make sure that there’s a range of volume appropriate for little ones. you also want to check that the actual sounds included are ones that you’ll find pleasant. many people like white noise.&& but there’s also pink or brown noise.&& which appeal to certain ears more. others like nature sounds.&& like waves on a shore or intermittent rainfall. with the conair sound therapy machine.&& there’s even a heartbeat thump you can play (some people might find this calming.&& but it reminds me of an edgar allan poe poem). i also like a sound machine with a timer.&& in case you don’t want to keep it running all night. advanced features may include am/fm radio.&& clocks.&& and app integration. most machines are similar shapes.&& but of course.&& there’s a range of color and aesthetic choices..&& the conair sound therapy machine has the basic features.&& with 10 sounds to pick from.&& good volume controls.&& and a 60-minute auto timer. the loop is fluid.&& so there aren’t any glaring stops and starts in the sound; it’s just a nice.&& consistent hum. the sound machine is relatively small.&& so it can be camouflaged in a corner of my daughter’s room and also packs up beautifully if you’re going out of town. our model has a battery backup in case of a power outage or if you’re somewhere without electricity. the machine is relatively simple compared to some of the other options out there.&& but it’s served us well in my daughter’s six years of life. .&& once our daughter moved from her bassinet in our room to her own nursery.&& we decided to invest in a sound machine—the conair sound therapy machine.&& to be exact. it was a game-changer..&& the first few nights of sleep-training our daughter in her new crib were excruciating; there’s just no sugarcoating that. but the sound machine helped ease her into a peaceful slumber. she was sleeping through the night in no time. of course.&& there are many factors that play into kids’ sleep.&& and no sound machine can be touted as a magic solution for all of the problems. but it can certainly help. .&& our home is pretty quiet.&& but there are certain times when it pays to have some noise in the background. during the fourth of july.&& the sound machine drowns out the fireworks and music. if we have guests.&& my daughter can sleep without us worrying that our conversation will keep her up. i can only imagine how useful a sound machine would be if there were siblings or pets running around..&& she adores her sound machine and turns it on before getting into bed.&& a ritual as consistent as brushing her teeth. we take the conair sound therapy with us on vacation.&& though once we forgot to pack it and instead ran out to buy another one as soon as our flight landed. no regrets at all. in fact.&& during nights when i need a little more sleep.&& i’ll turn on our backup sound machine for myself. works like a charm on adults as well as kids. .&& some parents prefer not to have kids indefinitely dependent on sound machines. if that’s the case.&& a trick i’ve heard is to gradually lower the volume on the sound machine each night.&& until it’s nearly silent. then turn it off and see how they do. you can also move the sound machine farther and farther out of the room each night for the same effect. .&& but in my opinion.&& sound machines are easy solutions to sleep-related woes that i’ll continue to lean on in the near future. hopefully.&& our beloved conair sound therapy will last us another six years. by then we’ll be using it to drown out our preteen daughter’s blaring music at bedtime..&& ][the beloved sound machine that’s lasted for six years, and counting, conair sound therapy, conair sound therapy, featured product, everlane canvas utility boot, more you might like, how to make the perfect cup of espresso, the best houseplants for plant killers, benefits of weighted blankets, according to occupational therapists, how you can save time with pressure cookers, new & noteworthy, how to make the perfect cup of espresso, the best kids tablets, according to technophiles, the best houseplants for plant killers, benefits of weighted blankets, according to occupational therapists]conair sound therapy machine | reviews by britannica[every product is independently curated by our reviews team., conair sound therapy, machine, conair sound therapy machine, conair sound therapy machine, conair sound therapy, machine, conair, sound, therapy, conair sound therapy][]
