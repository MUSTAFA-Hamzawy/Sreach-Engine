desktop.&& tablet and mobile. this page outlines how people can use the player and its accessibility features..&& we aim to provide subtitles.&& audio description and programmes in british sign language for as much content as possible across as many devices as possible. this will vary according to the product (i.e. news.&& iplayer.&& sport etc.) and is also dependent on device support. currently.&& subtitles are offered for on-demand programmes across bbc iplayer and for live programmes on the bbc iplayer website and tv app..&& when subtitles are available.&& look for the speech bubble icon in our apps and on the bbc iplayer website. it’s located within the player control bar. just select the icon to switch them on and off. you can choose the size of subtitles if using the bbc iplayer website and tv app..&& .&& when subtitles are switched on you can expect to see them at all times including when more information is presented at the bottom of the screen such as more episodes like this or more news items like this. also.&& when available.&& you can expect to see different colours used for different speakers making it easier to follow the conversation. subtitles may move around to allow important parts of the video to remain visible.&& such as faces.&& text.&& or action that is important to see when watching the programme..&& audio description and bsl content can be accessed from links in the page outside the player when they are available. bbc iplayer has dedicated categories where you can find audio described and signed content.&& and on the

navigation regardless of whether you are using a mouse.&& keyboard or other means of input..&& we have built in accessibility from the outset and will continue to make the media player progressively more accessible to screen reader users as it evolves. the accessibility of the player may.&& however.&& be affected due to changes in versions of the media player.&& the browser or the screen reader. while some issues are within our control others may be down to third-party partners.&& including media player or browser vendors and the screen reader. we research.&& user test and carry out technical testing regularly in order to ensure accessibility continues to be maintained and that we are giving people what they need..&&  ][accessibility links, , breadcrumb, accessibility help with playing
