[many of us (especially women) find that we have a timeline mapped out in our heads with how our lives will play out. landing that big job at 25, married by 27, kids by 30 is not a lot of time to accomplish those 3 big monumental life events. if your goals are stacked heavily on top of each other that sets you up for a lot of work and not a lot of living in between. , the center for systems science and engineering (csse) is a research collective housed within the department of civil and systems engineering (case) at johns hopkins university (jhu).  our faculty, researchers, and students
