[albert wan ran bleak house books.&& an independent bookstore in hong kong.&& for nearly five years.&& before closing it in late 2021. the changing political climate and crackdown on dissent within hong kong made life too uncertain for wan.&& his wife and two children. .&& as they were preparing to move.&& wan packed a box of books at risk of being purged by the government. he brought them on a plane back to the united states in january and donated them to the internet archive for preservation. .&& the collection includes books about the pro-democracy protests of 2019—some photography books; another was a limited edition book of essays by young journalists who covered the event. there was a book about the tiananmen square massacre and volumes about hong kong politics.&& culture and history—most written in chinese. .&& “in hong kong.&& because the government is restricting and policing speech in a way that is even causing libraries to remove books from shelves.&& i thought that it would be good to digitize books about hong kong that might be in danger of disappearing entirely.&&” wan said..&& “i thought that it would be good to digitize books about hong kong that might be in danger of disappearing entirely.”.&& hearing that bleak house books would be shutting its doors.&& the internet archive reached out and offered to digitize its remaining books. as it happens.&& wan said his inventory was dwindling quickly. so.&& he gathered contributions from others.&& and along with some from his own collection.&& donated about thirty books and some periodicals to the internet archive for preservation and digitization. wan said he was amazed at how flexible and open the archive was in the process.&& assisting with shipping and scanning the materials at no cost to him. (see hong kong community collection.).&& now.&& wan wants others to do the same..&& “there are still titles out there that have never been digitized and might be on the radar for being purged or sort of hidden from public view.&&” wan said. “the hope is that more people would contribute and donate those kinds of books to the archive and have them digitized so that people still have access to them.”.&& do you have books you’d like to donate to the internet archive? learn more..&& wan said he likes how the internet archive operates using controlled digital lending (cdl) where the items can be borrowed one at time.&& not infringing on the rights of the authors.&& while providing broad public access..&& before his family moved to hong kong for his wife’s university teaching job.&& wan was a civil rights and criminal defense attorney in private practice. now.&& they are all getting settled in rochester.&& new york.&& where wan plans to open another bookshop..&& lost landscapes is back!!

provide  useful  organizational  structure  to  large  volumes  of  data.  however.&&  construction of  these  hierarchies  is  difficult  using  established  ontologies  (e.g.  wordnet)  due  to the differences in the semantic and pragmatic use of words vs. hashtags in social media. while alternative construction methods based on hashtag frequency are relatively straightforward.&& these methods can be susceptible to the dynamic nature of social media.&&  such  as  hashtags  associated  with  surges  in  popularity.  we  drew  inspiration  from the ecologically-based shannon diversity index (sdi) to create a more representative and  resilient  method  of  semantic  hierarchy  construction  that  relies  upon  graph-based community detection and a novel.&& entropy-based ensemble diversity index (edi) score. the edi quantifies the contextual diversity of each hashtag.&& resulting in thousands of semantically-related groups of hashtags organized along a general-to-specific spectrum. through an application of edi to social media data (twitter) and a comparison of our results to prior approaches.&& we demonstrate our method’s ability to create semantically consistent hierarchies

of the community webs program. community webs advances the capacity for community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories and underrepresented voices. for more information.&& visit communitywebs.archive-it.org/.&& i was excited when i saw the call for participants in community webs. while wilmington.&& illinois is a small.&& rural town (5.&&664 people).&& the thought was that we still had something to contribute. most archive-it partners are universities.&& museums and large libraries.&& and being in their company was a little daunting to me initially. other institutions have someone who opens the project.&& and then it develops into a larger team project. wilmington public library district (wpld) has a much smaller staff; the project has been wholly mine.&& which has been both thrilling and terrifying. .&& wilmington is a small rural town.&& falling on the lower end of the economic scale.  because we are isolated.&&the library plays a vital part in the community.  we offer the usual storytimes and adult programs.&& but also loan out hotspots and chromebooks. we have 45 hotspots and these are almost always checked out; some people are using them for vacations.&& but by usage it is apparent that others are using them as their primary means of connecting to the internet. internet access has been more and more important.&& but after the covid-19 broke out.&& more governmental services went strictly online.&& making access even more critical – and to many who had not been regular patrons. wpld is a hub for the community.&& offering computers.&& information.&& tax forms.&& and a place to come in and chat – even more important when we are trying to stay close and limit outside contact..&& i am a chicago native who went to champaign-urbana for grad school. i was a scanner for the internet archive for several years where i was privileged to handle some incunabula (pre-1500 items). i am the technical services supervisor at wilmington; primarily i catalog our materials.&& but i also tend toward projects.&& from adding series labels to re-orienting all the calls in the juvenile non-fiction section.  i am currently going through our attic to help determine what we have (it’s a mystery!). i’m making lists.&& and hoping to have items to scan which would be available online.&& in multiple places. i applied for the community webs program (with my director’s blessing) because i felt that it’s important for small towns to be represented in the collection of history. only 20% of the population still lives outside major metro areas.&& but it is every bit as important to capture that life as it is to retain the history of large cities..&& wilmington library joined community webs in the summer of 2021. after some technical clarifications with the archive-it staff wlpd was set up. in considering what made wilmington unique.&& the first link was to our library and social media pages. social media has grown in importance in the last twenty years.&& but it became a vital link during covid when services were otherwise unavailable. wilmington library youtube videos.&& how-tos.&& crafts and storytime.&& stand to remind us of how we responded and as a continuing reference for parents who can’t get to the library. but since social media.&& specifically.&& is known for ‘right now.&&’ it lacks the kind of reflection over time that we can create through the community webs project..&& we may be small.&& but we have a number of historical articles and sites which needed to be brought together. we want to reflect events that have been impactful to our community.&& from the explosion of the joliet armory in the 1940s to the continuing issues with the wilmington dam.&& which has proved dangerous.&& but has complicated ownership issues. i still have a long way to go; the projects (attic/local history/web archive) are all intertwined. wilmington has the usual community resources and city government collections in archive-it. going forward.&& we want to continue to develop our wilmington history collection. we are working on local history and will establish a collection of materials from our attic and public donations. our local paper has vertical files which could be a goldmine of information – again.&& on my to-do list.  we will be kicking off an oral history project.&& which will begin with a series of simple gatherings/coffee hours for our seniors.&& providing a place for them to gather.&& and a space to share their stories. i am hoping these will be in our community webs archive. who better to speak to where we’ve been and where we are than some of our oldest residents?.&& why is community webs important? because it will help to remember when we cannot keep up with the information overload. because there is so much happening that we miss a good deal of what is around us – or can’t bear to face it for long. because so very very much of our lives are now online – and can be erased with a keystroke. because we are seeing.&& painfully.&& that those who do not learn from the past will be/are condemned to re-live it. and.&& for wilmington.&& i think it is important because so many of the voices and sites being captured are from museums.&& universities and large public libraries. it is important that we remember that we used to be far less urban than we are today. it is important to remember the smaller places.&& those who are too easily lost in the maelstrom of modern life.&& because to be forgotten is to be erased..&& at a recent webinar hosted by the internet archive.&& leaders from the biodiversity heritage library (bhl) shared how its massive open access digital collection documenting life on the planet is an invaluable resource of use to scientists and ordinary citizens..&& “the bhl is a global consortium of the  leading natural history museums.&& botanical gardens.&& and research institutions — big and

antiquated experience of searching for specific topics within video.&&” said macdonald.&& who helped lead the effort. “the tv caption search enabled discovery at internet speed with the ability to simultaneously search millions of programs and have your results plotted over time.&& down to individual broadcasters and programs.”.&& “[television] is such an influential.&& important medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote. we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.”.&& scholars and journalists were quick to embrace this opportunity.&& but the team kept experimenting with deeper indexing. techniques like audio fingerprinting.&& optical character recognition (ocr) and computer vision made it possible to capture visual elements of the news and improve access.&& macdonald said. .&& sub-collections of political leaders’ speeches and interviews have been created.&& including an extensive donald trump archive. some of the archive’s most productive advances have come from collaborating with outsiders who have requested more access to the collection than is available through the public interface.&& macdonald said. with appropriate restrictions to maintain respect for broadcasters and distribution platforms.&& the archive has worked with select scientists and journalists as partners to use data in the collection for more complex analyses..&& treating television news as data creates vast opportunities for computational analysis.&& said leetaru. researchers can track word frequency use in the news and how that has changed over time.  for instance.&& it’s possible to look at mentions of covid-related words across selected news programs and see when it surged and leveled off with each wave before plummeting downward.&& as shown in the graph below..&& the newly computed metadata can help provide context and assist with fact checking efforts to combat misinformation. it can allow researchers to map the geography of television news—how certain parts of the world are covered more than others.&& leetaru said. through the collections.&& researchers have explored  which presidential tweets challenging election integrity got the most exposure on the news.  ocr of every frame has been used to create models of how to identify names of every “dr.” depicted on cable tv after the outbreak of covid-19 and calculate air time devoted to the medical doctors commenting on one of the virus variants.  reverse image lookup of images in tv news has been used to determine the source of photos and videos.  visual entity search tools can even reveal the increasing prevalence of bookshelves as backdrops during home interviews in the pandemic.&& as well as appearances of books by specific authors or titles. open datasets of computed tv news metadata are available that include all visual entity and ocr detections.&& 10-minute interval captioning ngrams and second by second inventories of each broadcast cataloging whether it was “news” programming.&& “advertising” programming or “uncaptioned” (in the case of television news this is almost exclusively advertising)..&& from television news to digitized books and periodicals.&& dozens of projects rely on the collections available at archive.org for computational and bibliographic research across a large digital corpus. data scientists or anyone with questions about the tv news archives.&& can contact info@archive.org..&& this webinar was the fourth a series of six sessions highlighting how researchers in the humanities use the internet archive. the next will be about analyzing biodiversity literature at scale on april 27. register here.][internet archive blogs, a blog from the team at archive.org, preserving pro-democracy
