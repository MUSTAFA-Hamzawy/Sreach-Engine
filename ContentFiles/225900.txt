best practices xiaoyu shen, gianni barlacchi, marco del tredici, weiwei cheng, adria de gispert, bill byrne acl 2022 ecnlp workshop 2022 it is of great value to answer product questions based on heterogeneous information sources available on web product pages, e.g., semistructured attributes, text descriptions, user-provided contents, etc. however, these sources have different structures and writing styles, which poses challenges for (1) evidence ranking, (2) source selection, and (3) answer generation. in this paper, we build a benchmark conversational ai / natural-language processing, question rewriting for open-domain conversational qa: best practices and limitations marco del tredici, gianni barlacchi, xiaoyu shen, weiwei cheng, adria de gispert cikm 2021 2021 open-domain conversational qa (odcqa) calls for effective question rewriting (qr), as the questions in a conversation typically lack proper context for the qa model to interpret. in this paper, we compare two types of qr approaches, generative and expansive qr, in end-to-end odcqa systems with recently released qrecc and or-quac benchmarks. while it is common practice to apply the same qr approach for both conversational ai / natural-language processing, question answering using web lists anoop r katti, kai hui, adria de gispert, hagen fuerstenau cikm 2021 2021 there are many natural questions that are best answered with a list. we address the problem of answering such questions using lists that occur on the web, i.e. list question answering (listqa). the diverse formats of lists on theweb makes this task challenging. we describe state-of-the-art methods for list extraction and ranking, that also consider the text surrounding the lists as context. due to the lack conversational ai /
