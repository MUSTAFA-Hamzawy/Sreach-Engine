superficial documentation, and these resources aren't listed in their netscape.ad file. anyway, for running under x, each little bit of netscape's menus is a resouce that you can customize. for

>touchy, touchy..., i was chided by e-mail by one of the web gods at teleport for being so critical of netscape, so apparently i needed to gush more in my praise., your browser is a beautiful thing, and an answer to prayer. i'm new to the web, and i've suffered through one stupid thing after another with every browser i've used 'til now--ncsa mos., cello, and winweb. i fell in love with netscape the minute i opened it and could read the text on your home page while the image was loading. i married it when i stopped a page in mid-load and nothing exploded. we had our first child after i tremulously tried using forms and mail-to links and found they were supported. i love netscape mosaic. i use it to read newsgroups as often as i do my "official" news reader now. it is a delight, a dream, a trip through the infobahn on gossamer wings. every day i find something wonderful and new about it--the fact that it recognizes urls in posts...siiiighhhh...being able to turn graphics on and off with a push of a button...bliss..., although the above is idiotically flowery, it's not far from the truth. i really do love your product, i look forward to the full product, i've deleted every other reader from my drive, and if you keep making them like this you'll have a customer for life., no kidding., (dang, man--i didn't even start the stupid "no printing" thing--i got into it because i jumped in and said "yes it does have printing, i'm sure it does!" and then realized i was wrong...), you are going to produce a version specifically geared to the special needs of african americans, right?, , , , , , , , , has anyone else using netscape under windows noticed this peculiar little quirk?, when netscape accesses a page with more than a couple of in-line images only the first two or three appear... the rest are never loaded, and come up as 'cutsie' symbols... i haven't figured out any rhyme or reason for which inline images are loaded, except that it starts at the first one and loads a 'few' then stops., very quirky..., mark, , , , , , gil kasparek kasp...@spy.org, i have been experiencing something similar. netscape for windows will hang after loading 839-843 bytes of any page from my server (http://msuinfo.ur.msstate.edu/) even if it has no graphics. apparently this only happens to machines on my subnet; more remote users report no problems. i've had no problems in this regard with the mac version., bennet george (geo...@ur.msstate.edu), , which platform/browser are you using?, what is the url(s)?, , actually, what seems to be causing most of these problems is that the number of simultaneous connections netscape thinks its allowed to make is larger than the number the winsock is configured to allow., the best solution is to lower the number netscape is allowed (network and images pane of the preferences box) or increase the number of connections your winsock allows., -chris cho...@mcom.com, , , hello all!, i solved the problem using a combination of the above suggestion and my own idea., since i am running the server that i have trouble loading by netscape i changed the maximum number of connections that my server could handle to a higher number.
