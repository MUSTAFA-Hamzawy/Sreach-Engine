you might start learning the new trade you want, applying for new jobs, or maybe getting started on a diet, you likely know how easy it is to fall into the bad habit of putting it off and putting it off some more. without holding yourself accountable, all you’re likely to get is more and more procrastination., if you want to live a better life, productivity is king. very few of us are lucky enough to just have our hopes and dreams appear out of thin air. opportunities have to be sought out and made. there’s no room for excuses! you have to stop being lenient when you break promises to yourself or fall short on particular goals. it’s all about pushing for more. it’s as they say, “nothing worth having comes quickly.” if you want something, you have to work tirelessly to get it. no
