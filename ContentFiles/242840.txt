[courtney smethers’ path to success was 17 years in the making. she joined amazon in february 2005 as a temporary associate at a fulfillment center in fernley.&& nevada. fresh out of high school.&& she needed a job before leaving for college.&& and her parents suggested amazon..&& she didn’t understand why her parents thought she would want to work on a computer all day.&& which is what she thought everyone at amazon did. she quickly learned that amazon offered numerous roles that didn’t involve that kind of computer commitment..&& fast-forward to october 2005.&& smethers returned to amazon after her temporary work was complete.&& and met her future husband during orientation. this time.&& she would stay at amazon. her nearly two-decade career has included several roles and promotions.&& from picking and packing customer orders to working as an ambassador.&& a process assistant.&& and eventually the general manager’s assistant..&& “amazon is part of who i am.&&” smethers said. “i grew up here. i met my husband here. i had my babies here.”.&& in 2020.&& amid the covid-19 pandemic.&& she helped the operations internal communications team share important information with employees. a few months later.&& she officially joined the team to support communications for customer fulfillment associates. smethers.&& who is now finishing her degree in strategic communications and will graduate this spring.&& said her experience helps her connect with employees across amazon operations..&& “starting out as an associate.&& ive walked plenty of miles in their shoes.&&” she said. “in every role that ive had.&& ive always been able to bring that voice to the table and advocate for my friends.”.&& smethers also has advice for employees: “dont limit yourself. if theres something that youre passionate about.&& i guarantee theres a role at amazon that would meet that passion and help you grow. when i joined the internal comms team.&& i was like.&& ‘this is everything that ive ever loved about every previous role that ive had.’.&& “your path doesn’t have to be what everyone else’s is.&&” she added. “just take that next step.”.&& from there.&& amazon encourages employees to define their own path. “we always say.&& ‘you should own your career at amazon.&&’ and thats really true.&&” said smethers. “i dont think anyones ever handed anything to me. ive always had to work for it. i think that everyone has that opportunity to put the work in.&& be vocal about what they want.&& and go to that next level.”][follow this amazon employees 17-year career, how
