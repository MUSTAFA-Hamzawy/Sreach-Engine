verification, model checking, provable security, better counterexamples for dafny aleksandar chakarov, aleksandr fedchin, zvonimir rakamarić, neha rungta tacas 2022 2022 dafny is a verifcation-aware programming language used at amazon web services to develop critical components of their access management, storage, and cryptography infrastructures. the dafny toolchain provides a verifer that can prove an implementation of a method satisfies its specification. when the underlying smt solver cannot establish a proof, it generates a counterexample. these counterexamples are automated reasoning,

mathews cav 2021 2021 in this industrial case study we describe a new network troubleshooting analysis used by vpc reachability analyzer, an smt-based network reachability analysis and debugging tool. our troubleshooting analysis uses a formal model of aws virtual private cloud (vpc) semantics to identify whether a destination is reachable from a source in a given vpc configuration. in the case where there is no feasible path automated reasoning, using model checking tools to triage the severity of security bugs in the xen hypervisor byron cook, björn döbel, daniel kroening, norbert manthey, martin pohlack, elizabeth polgreen, michael tautschnig, pawel wieczorkiewicz fmcad 2020 2020 in practice, few security bugs found in source code are urgent, but quickly identifying which ones are is hard. we describe the application of bounded model checking to triaging reported issues quickly at the cloud service provider amazon web services (aws). we focus on the job of reactive security experts who need to determine the severity of bugs found in the xen hypervisor. we show that, using our publicly automated reasoning, stratified abstraction of access control policies john backes,

schodde, anvesh tanuku, carsten varming, deepa viswanathan cav 2020 2020 the shift to cloud-based apis has made application security critically depend on understanding and reasoning about policies that regulate access to cloud resources. we present stratified predicate abstraction, a new approach that summarizes complex security policies into a compact set of positive and declarative statements that precisely state who has access to a resource. we have implemented stratified cloud and systems, code-level model checking in the software development workflow nathan chong, byron cook, konstantinos kallas, kareem khazem, felipe monteiro, daniel schwartz-narbonne, serdar tasiran, michael tautschnig, mark r. tuttle icse 2020 2020 this experience report describes a style of applying symbolic model checking developed over the course of four years at amazon web services (aws). lessons learned are drawn from proving properties of numerous c-based systems, e.g., custom hypervisors, encryption code, boot loaders, and an iot operating system. using our methodology, we find that we can prove the correctness of industrial low-level c-based related: how to integrate formal proofs
