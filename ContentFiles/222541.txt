[an equation is made up of two expressions — sets of numbers and variables — connected by an equal sign., kutaytanir/e+/getty images, by maria temming, march 28, 2022 at 6:30 am, an equation is a statement in math that says two things are equal. all equations contain an equal sign (=). the set of numbers and/or variables on either side of that sign is called an expression. (variables are unknown values typically written as letters)., the difference between an expression and an equation is sort of like the difference between a phrase and a sentence. a phrase contains a single idea that is incomplete by itself. a sentence makes a complete statement. likewise, an expression conveys a single idea — such as “one plus two” (1+2) or “x minus y” (x–y). an equation represents a complete sentence, such as one plus two equals three (1+2=3). or, x minus y equals z (x–y=z)., formulas are a special type of equation. they express an important relationship between two or more variables. for instance, the formula a=πr2 shows how the area of a circle (a) is related to its radius (r). (the area equals the constant pi (π) times the radius squared.) formulas are used to express many rules in geometry and laws of physics. one example is f=ma. that is, force (f) equals mass (m) times acceleration (a)., equations are not the only kind of “complete sentences” in math. inequalities also link up expressions to form complete ideas. an inequality says that one expression is bigger or smaller than another. for example, “x is greater than y” (x > y) or “y is less than z” (y < z). but inequalities don’t contain equal signs. so they aren’t equations., the drake equation relates the number of advanced alien civilizations that could exist in our galaxy to factors such as the number of stars with planets and the number of those planets that could host life., check out the full list

speed or direction of some object., constant: (in mathematics) a number that is known and unchanging, usually based on some mathematical definition. for example, π (pi) is a constant equal to 3.14. . . and defined as the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter., equation: in mathematics, the statement that two quantities are equal. in geometry, equations are often used to determine the shape of a curve or surface., expression: (in mathematics) a statement that involves combinations of numbers and/or letters (that signify numbers that may vary) and includes directions (or rules) about what to do with those numbers (such as add or divide them, take their logarithm or make combinations of them equal one another)., force: some outside influence that can change the motion of a body, hold bodies close to one another, or produce motion or stress in a stationary body., link: a connection between two people or things., physics: the scientific study of the nature and properties of matter and energy. classical physics is an explanation of the nature and properties of matter and energy that relies on descriptions such as newton’s laws of motion. quantum physics, a field of study that emerged later, is a more accurate way of explaining the motions and behavior of matter. a scientist who works in such areas is known as a physicist., pi: (in mathematics) usually written using the greek letter π. it is a constant equal to 3.14. . . and defined as the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter., radius: a straight line from the center to the circumference of a circle or sphere., square: (in mathematics) a number multiplied by itself, or the verb meaning to multiply a number by itself. the square of 2 is 4; the square of 10 is 100., variable: (in mathematics) a letter used in a mathematical expression that may take on different values., maria temming is the assistant editor at science news for students. she has bachelor's degrees in physics
