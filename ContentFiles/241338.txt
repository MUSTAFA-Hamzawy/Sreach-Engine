and to the customer’s satisfaction. please contact our customer support at 833-967-7829 or at [email protected]. in the event that you’re not satisfied with customer service’s solution (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally).&& we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction..&& arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.&& allows for more limited discovery than in court.&& and is subject to very limited review by courts. unless expressly limited by this dispute resolution provision.&& arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. any arbitration under this agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75.&&000.&& we will pay all costs of the arbitration. moreover.&& in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from us to at least the same extent as you would be in court..&& in addition.&& under certain circumstances (as explained below).&& we will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute..&& (a) claims subject to arbitration: you and we agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us.&& except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing.&& protecting.&& or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors.&& affiliates and partners). this agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. it includes.&& but is not limited to:.&& references to “we.&&” “our.&&” and “us” (unless the context requires otherwise) include our respective subsidiaries.&& affiliates.&& agents.&& employees.&& licensees.&& licensors.&& and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; our respective predecessors in interest.&& successors.&& and assigns (including warner bros. discovery.&& inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates); and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or prior agreements between us. notwithstanding the foregoing.&& either party may bring an action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief.&& so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal.&& state.&& or local agencies. such agencies can.&& if the law allows.&& seek relief against us on your behalf. you agree that.&& by entering into this agreement.&& you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. this agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce.&& and thus the federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. this arbitration provision shall survive termination of this agreement..&& (b) pre-arbitration notice of disputes: a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written notice of dispute (“notice”). the notice to us should be sent by email to: [email protected]. the notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“demand”)..&& if we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the notice is received.&& you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. during the arbitration.&& the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount.&& if any.&& to which you or us is entitled. you may download a form to initiate arbitration at: adr.org/sites/default/files/consumer_demand_for_arbitration_form_1.pdf..&& (c) arbitration procedure: the arbitration will be governed by the consumer arbitration rules (“aaa rules”) of the american arbitration association (“aaa”).&& as modified by this arbitration provision.&& and will be administered by the aaa. (if the aaa is unavailable.&& another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.) the aaa rules are available online at www.adr.org.&& by calling the aaa at 1-800-778-7879.&& or by requesting them in writing at the notice address. all issues are for the arbitrator to decide.&& except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide. the arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. unless we and you agree otherwise.&& any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.&& or if we do not have a billing address.&& then in the county (or parish) where you reside. if your claim is for $10.&&000 or less.&& we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.&& through a telephonic hearing.&& or by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules. if your claim exceeds $10.&&000.&& the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted.&& the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. except as provided in subsection (f) below.&& the arbitrator can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award under applicable law..&& (d) arbitration fees: after we receive notice at the notice address that you have commenced arbitration.&& we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee.&& unless your claim is for greater than $75.&&000 in value. (the filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. if you are unable to pay this fee.&& we will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the notice address.) we will pay all aaa filing.&& administration.&& and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. if.&& however.&& the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11(b)).&& then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the aaa rules. in such case.&& you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules. in addition.&& if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75.&&000 (either to you or to us).&& the payment of these fees will be governed by the aaa rules..&& (e) alternative payment and attorney premium: if you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (b) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected.&& then we will:.&& if we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected.&& you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium.&& respectively.&& if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees.&& expenses.&& and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. in assessing whether an award that includes attorneys’ fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer.&& the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys’ fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer..&& the right to the attorney premium supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. thus.&& if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law.&& this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. however.&& you may not recover both the attorney premium and a duplicative award of attorneys’ fees or costs. although under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in an arbitration.&& we agree that we will not seek such an award..&& (f) requirement of individual arbitration: the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. you and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity.&& and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class.&& representative.&& or private attorney general proceeding. further.&& unless both you and we agree otherwise.&& the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative.&& class.&& or private attorney general proceeding. if.&& after exhaustion of all appeals.&& any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class.&& representative.&& and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim).&& then that claim or request for relief shall be severed.&& and all other claims and requests for relief shall be arbitrated..&& (g) future changes to arbitration provision: notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary.&& we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice address) during your service commitment.&& you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the arbitration notice address provided above. by rejecting any future change.&& you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision..&& 10. severability..&& except as specified in section 9 (dispute resolution).&& if any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful.&& void.&& or for any reason unenforceable.&& then that provision shall be deemed severable for this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. this is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained herein..&& 11. last updated..&& these terms of use were last updated on april 11.&& 2022..&& tm & © 2022 all rights reserved..&& ][terms of use]terms of use | warnermedia privacy center[this agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than courts or jury trials, and limits the remedies available in the event of a dispute., 1. introduction., (a) governing terms., (b) changes to terms of use., (c) changes to privacy center., (d) verification, (e) equipment., 2. acceptable use., 3. the privacy center., 4. third party content., 5. unsolicited submissions and feedback., 6. disclaimer of warranty., 7. limitation of liability and time limitation for claims., 8. governing law., 9. dispute resolution., in the event that you’re not satisfied with customer service’s solution (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute we have with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction., any arbitration under this agreement will take place on an individual basis;
