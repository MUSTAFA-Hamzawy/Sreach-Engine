filtering, extreme multilabel classification, learning to rank, question answering, recommender systems, helping voice shoppers make purchase decisions gustavo penha, eyal krikon, vanessa murdock, sandeep avula chi 2022 2022 online shoppers have a lot of information at their disposal when making a purchase decision. they can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. voice shopping (purchasing items via a voice assistant such as amazon alexa or google assistant) is different. voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel search and information retrieval, hcl: hybrid contrastive learning for graph-based recommendation xiyao ma, zheng gao, qian hu, mohamed abdelhady ijcnn 2022 2022 graph-based collaborative filtering for recommendation has attracted great attention recently, due to its effectiveness of capturing high-order proximity among users and items. to further improve its model robustness and alleviate label-sparsity issue, contrastive learning has been introduced to polish user and item representation by contrasting different views of user/item nodes, learning necessary and machine learning, retrieval-augmented multilingual keyphrase generation with retriever-generator iterative training yifan gao, qingyu yin, zheng li, rui meng, tong zhao, bing yin, irwin king, michael r. lyu naacl 2022 2022 keyphrase generation is the task of automatically predicting keyphrases given a piece of long text. despite its recent flourishing, keyphrase generation on non-english languages haven’t been vastly investigated. in this paper, we call attention to a new setting named multilingual keyphrase generation and we contribute two new datasets, ecommercemkp and academicmkp, covering six languages. technically, we search and information retrieval, augmenting training data for massive semantic matching models in low-traffic e-commerce stores ashutosh joshi, shankar vishwanath, choon hui teo, vaclav petricek, vishy vishwanathan, rahul bhagat, jonathan may naacl 2022 2022 extreme multi-label classification (xmc) systems have been successfully applied in ecommerce (shen et al., 2020; dahiya et al., 2021) for retrieving products based on customer behavior. such systems require large amounts of customer behavior data (e.g. queries, clicks, purchases) for training. however, behavioral data is limited in low-traffic e-commerce stores, impacting performance of these systems. in search and information retrieval, relevance under the iceberg: reasonable prediction for extreme multi-label classification jyun-yu jiang, wei-cheng chang, jiong zhang, cho-jui hsieh, hsiang-fu yu sigir 2022 2022 in the era of big data, extreme multi-label classification (xmc) has already become one of the most essential research tasks to deal with enormous label spaces in machine learning applications. instead of assessing every individual label, most xmc methods rely on label trees or filters to derive short ranked label lists as prediction, thereby reducing computational overhead. specifically, existing studies machine learning, more-efficient caching for
