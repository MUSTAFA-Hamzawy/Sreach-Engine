[.&& samm [sic] asks “what does [sic] mean?”.&& sic in square brackets is an editing term used with quotations or excerpts. it means “that’s really how it appears in the original.”.&& it is used to point out a grammatical error.&& misspelling.&& misstatement of fact.&& or.&& as above.&& the unconventional spelling of a name..&& for example.&& you might want to quote the printed introduction to a college catalog:.&& maple leaf college is well-known for it’s [sic] high academic standards..&& sic is the latin word for “thus.&&” or “such.”.&& when john wilkes booth shot abraham lincoln and jumped from the balcony to the stage of ford’s theatre.&& he is said to have shouted “sic semper tyrannis!” he meant “that’s what tyrants get;” literally.&& “thus always to tyrants.”.&& another common latin expression you might come across is sic transit gloria mundi. it means “thus passes the glory of the world.” it’s a thought that might occur as one stands by a crumbling pyramid or where the twin towers once stood in new york city..&& where i grew up.&& people who wanted a dog to attack said “sic ’em!” i’ve seen it in a dictionary spelled “sick.&&” as in “sick him!” this use is first recorded in 1845 and may come from a dialectal version of seek.&& “to look for” or “to pursue.”.&& bernheimer wrote: “salonen isn’t one of those conductors who pretends ( sic ) not to read criticism.” and “salonen is not one of those lofty musicians who believes ( sic ) that art can survive in a vacuum.” — la times.&& remembr speling?.&& neither does our president. in his first tweet as potus — posted

.&& since [sic] is designed to draw attention to something that may be misspelled.&& incorrect.&& or at the very least unusual.&& it may not always be appropriate to use it when you’re quoting someone. it depends on what you’re writing and on your relationship with the person being quoted..&& if you’re writing an academic paper.&& then [sic] is almost always appropriate where necessary: it makes it clear that any error or mistake is not your own.&& or it highlights an unusual spelling that readers might otherwise assume is incorrect..&& if you’re quoting someone in a newspaper report.&& you might consider it necessary to use [sic] to ensure that you preserve the accuracy of the quote whilst also making it clear to readers that you do.&& in fact.&& know that “would of” is ungrammatical..&& in other contexts.&& though.&& you might seek an alternative to using [sic]. perhaps you’re quoting someone you admire in a blog post.&& and you don’t want to inadvertently make them

little formal and stilted..&& finally.&& if you want to introduce a quick.&& brief quote that doesn’t draw attention away from your own writing.&& you may feel that using [sic] is a little distracting for the reader..&& in any of the above situations.&& or in any other instance when you’d prefer not to use [sic].&& good alternatives include:.&& ultimately.&& there is no rule that you must use [sic] – so consider whether it’s appropriate for your context and purposes..&& also.&& of course.&& if you are going to use [sic] when quoting someone or sharing an excerpt of a piece of writing.&& do be very careful that you have the correct facts (or correct spelling). if you use [sic] because you’ve misunderstood an unusual word or a point of grammar.&& then that could look a little silly..&&

properly present the written text in his/her report, which would later become testimonial in court, he/she would write the message as, “put the mony [sic] in the bag.”, so readers would know the originator misspelled the word and not the investigator. [sic] is not properly used for quoting spoken words. for textual quoting of spoken words, when the writer is unsure of spelling, such as a person’s name, the abbreviation (ph), to indicate a phonetic spelling, is appropriate. brackets are used when inserting words into quoted text that are not part of the original quote. parenthesis are used to make parenthetical comments in a sentence, which may be explanatory, but not contextually appropriate to include in the sentence. they are not interchangeable, as is commonly supposed. hope that long-winded explanation has some value for somebody., zopoon april 21, 2010 10:42 am i think i will go for “said in context” from @zeke sounds like the most reasonable explanation. or “sentence in context”. that could work also. thank you either way everyone i have always wondered what it meant., maquion april 28, 2010 12:04 pm i always thought it stood for “spelling in cuestion” yeah, i know… i thought someone else had the spelling wrong. i’m the true idiot, and i win., deep6dlhon may 19, 2010 6:42 pm this is a much clear explanation, and much simplier. (remembering ockham’s razor) sic is a latin word meaning “thus”, “so”, “as such”, or “in such a manner”. it is used when writing quoted material to indicate that an incorrect or unusual spelling, phrase, punctuation or meaning in the quote has been reproduced verbatim from the original and is not a transcription error. – wikipedia, deep6dlhon may 19, 2010 6:43 pm …and someday i hope to be able to spell., rebon may 28, 2010 9:13 am hmm, most interesting thing i have read in a while. always had an idea of what this meant but could not have asked for a better put out explanation, what a shame for common english to have phased out so much of the old latin of the day, alsayron july 11, 2010 12:26 pm for some reason i had thought this was “see inline comment” glad i finally googled it!, greg lohron july 13, 2010 11:13 am it’s good to learn something new everyday…and today i have! and i ordered the free ebook as well, so my day is off to a good start. ~ greg, doreen richersonon july 16, 2010 12:36 pm great information. now i know where to go to get answers. thank you., mcgeeon august 02, 2010 7:14 am i always thought it was simply from the slipknot song “[sic]” at the end of all their concerts they say, “stay sic”, [sic] fanon september 11, 2010 8:21 pm @mcgee: i really enjoyed your comment. all of them were quite bluntly put. i thought of the latin meaning from “sic transit gloria mundi” but didn’t see the [sic] part actually fit in the context, so i mostly settled for the idea that the writer was making fun of the reader, as in: “sic! i told you so!”. it doesn’t make much sense. at all. about the slipknot song, i know what you’re talking about. they also have an album entitled mfkr which stands for mate feed kill repeat, so the sic thing might get one confused., markon october 18, 2010 9:25 pm tony your explanation was the one that cemented in my skull . thanks., reneeon november 12, 2010 12:12 pm right on, tony! thanks., dollyon november 23, 2010 7:29 pm spelt/spelling in context, by gollyon january 02, 2011 12:49 pm [sic] means said in context., bobon january 11, 2011 9:14 pm if the “i” had a macron, it would mean “yes” in latin. 8d, business writing, book reviews, mistakes, expressions, fiction writing, freelance writing, general, grammar, grammar 101, misused words, punctuation, spelling, style, vocabulary, writing basics, usage review, writing quizzes, home, archives, exercises, about, contact, privacy policy]
