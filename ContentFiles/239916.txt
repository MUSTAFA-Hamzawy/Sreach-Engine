[developer terms.&& twitter loves developers. we’re delighted and amazed by the tools and services this community creates by harnessing the power of twitter data. as part of our commitment to this community.&& we aim to provide data access that is open and fair for developers.&& safe for people on twitter.&& and beneficial for the twitter platform as a whole. to further these goals we’ve crafted the developer policy as a guide to help people understand our rules and expectations about appropriate api and twitter content usage..&& this developer policy (“policy”) provides rules and guidelines for developers who interact with twitter’s ecosystem of applications.&& services.&& website.&& web pages and content. it is part of your contract with twitter governing access to and use of the twitter api and twitter content (either as part of the developer agreement or other written agreement with twitter). policy violations are considered violations of your agreement. this policy may be changed from time to time without notice. capitalized terms used in this policy.&& which are not defined in this policy.&& will have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the developer agreement or the master license agreement..&& we’ve structured this policy to make it as easy to follow as possible. please keep information from the following policy sections top of mind as you use the twitter api and twitter content:.&& we’ve provided a lot more detail on what each of these three key sections mean below. please review them carefully to ensure that your usage of the twitter api and twitter content is consistent with our policies. .&& if we believe you are in violation of this policy (or any other twitter policy).&& we may suspend or permanently revoke your access to the twitter api and twitter content. if this happens to you.&& do not apply for or register additional api keys. instead.&& contact us via the api policy support form.  .&& finally.&& please note that twitter may monitor your use of the twitter api to improve the twitter applications.&& to examine any commercial use.&& and to ensure your compliance with your approved use case and this policy..&& thanks for reading.&& and thank you for building with us! we look forward to seeing what you create!.&& chapter 1.&& you can avoid many potential pitfalls while using the twitter api by ensuring that your service has been built the right way from day 1. this section of the developer policy contains rules that all developers must follow before using the twitter api or twitter content..&& we review all proposed uses of the twitter developer platform to verify policy compliance — so you’re required to disclose (and update.&& as applicable) your planned use of the twitter api and twitter content in order to be granted and to maintain access. all new developers must apply for a developer account to access the twitter api. current developers without an approved developer account must apply for one as directed to do so by twitter. as part of this process.&& you’ll need to provide us with a written description of your intended uses of the twitter api and twitter content..&& your use case description is binding on you.&& and any substantive deviation from it may constitute a violation of our rules and result in enforcement action. you must notify us of any substantive modification to your use case and receive approval before you may begin using twitter content for that new purpose. failure to do so may result in suspension and termination of your api and data access. you can update your use case by visiting our api policy support form.&& selecting i need to update my developer use case.&& or as otherwise agreed by twitter..&& by building on the twitter api or accessing

these policies and any new policies launched by twitter. it is your responsibility to monitor the use of your service and to design your service to prevent violations of twitter policy by people who use it. failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of your api and twitter content access..&& you may not register multiple applications for a single use case or substantially similar or overlapping use cases. in this context.&& a “use case” is a consistent set of analyses.&& displays.&& or actions performed via an application. please note that providing the same service or application to different people (including “white label” versions of a tool or service) counts as a single use case..&& as a single exception to these rules.&& you may create and use a maximum of 3 applications for development.&& staging.&& and production instances of the same service. these apps must be registered to a single account.&& and should be clearly identified (in the name and description) as dev.&& staging.&& and prod instances of a single service. you may not use development or staging applications for production purposes..&& you must keep all api keys or other access credentials private. you may not use.&& and may not encourage or facilitate others to use.&& api keys or other access credentials owned by others..&& your license agreement with twitter limits your use of the twitter api and twitter content. among other things.&& the twitter api has rate limits which help to ensure fair data usage and to combat spam on the platform. you may not exceed or circumvent rate limits.&& or any other limitations or restrictions described in this policy or your agreement with twitter.&& listed on the developer site.&& or communicated to you by twitter..&& you may not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on twitter content received via the twitter api. this helps to make sure that people know where twitter content is coming from.&& and who it belongs to..&& for data integrity and platform health reasons.&& you may not interfere with.&& intercept.&& disrupt.&& or disable any features of the twitter api or the twitter service. in other words.&& use the apis as intended and documented on developer.twitter.com. refer to our hackerone guidelines for more details about acceptable use..&& chapter 2.&& twitter takes privacy seriously.&& and we expect everyone using twitter content and the twitter api to do the same. any use of the twitter developer platform.&& twitter api.&& or twitter content in a manner that is inconsistent with peoples’ reasonable expectations of privacy may be subject to enforcement action.&& which can include suspension and termination of api and twitter content access..&& your commitment to privacy and control must extend to all uses of twitter content and all aspects of the service that you build using our api. to that end.&& the people using your service must understand and consent to how you use their data.&& and how you access twitter on their behalf. this can be accomplished through providing people with a clear.&& comprehensive.&& and transparent privacy policy.&& as well as ensuring that you get express and informed consent from each person using your service before taking any action on their behalf. please note that a person authenticating into your service does not by itself constitute consent..&& in particular.&& you must get express and informed consent from people before doing any of the following:.&& taking any actions on their behalf. this includes (but is not limited to): .&& posting content to twitter.&& following/unfollowing accounts.&& modifying profile or account information.&& starting a periscope broadcast.&& adding hashtags or any other content to tweets  .&& republishing content accessed by means other than via the twitter api or other twitter tools.&& using someone’s twitter content to promote a product or service.&& storing non-public content such as direct messages (dms).&& or any other private or confidential information.&& sharing or publishing protected content.&& or any other private or confidential information.&& if your service allows people to post content to twitter you must do the following before publishing:.&& show exactly what will be published.&& make it clear to people using your service what geo information (if any) will be added to the content.&& if your service allows people to post content to both your service and twitter.&& you must do the following before publishing:.&& obtain permission to post the content.&& explain where you will post the content.&& you must respect the protected and blocked status of all twitter content. you may not serve content obtained using one person’s authentication token to a different person who is not authorized to view that content..&& protected accounts: a protected account’s content is only available to people who have been approved by the owner to follow that account. so.&& if you run a service that accesses protected accounts.&& you may only do so to serve such content to the specific people with permission to view that content..&& blocked accounts: people on twitter are able to block access to their accounts for any reason they choose. commingling information obtained from tokens (or any other api-based action) to bypass this choice is not permitted..&& as direct messages (dms) are non-public in nature.&& services that provide dm features must take extra steps to safeguard personal privacy. you may not serve dm content to people who are not authorized to view that content. if your service provides dm functionality you must also:.&& get consent before configuring media to be sent in a dm as shared (i.e. reusable across multiple dms). if you do allow media in a dm to be “shared.&&” you must provide a clear notice that this content will be accessible to anyone with the media’s url..&& if you store twitter content offline.&& you must keep it up to date with the current state of that content on twitter. specifically.&& you must delete or modify any content you have if it is deleted or modified on twitter. this must be done as soon as reasonably possible.&& or within 24 hours after receiving a request to do so by twitter or the applicable twitter account owner.&& or as otherwise required by your agreement with twitter or applicable law. this must be done unless otherwise prohibited by law.&& and only then with the express written permission of twitter..&& modified content can take various forms. this includes (but is not limited to): .&& content that has been suspended from the platform.&& content that has had geotags removed from it.&& content that has been withheld or removed from twitter.&& we limit the circumstances under which you may match a person on twitter to information obtained or stored off-twitter. off-twitter matching involves associating twitter content.&& including a twitter @handle or user id.&& with a person.&& household.&& device.&& browser.&& or other off-twitter identifier. you may only do this if you have express opt-in consent from the person before making the association.&& or as described below..&& in situations in which you don’t have a person’s express.&& opt-in consent to link their twitter identity to an off-twitter identifier.&& we require that any connection you draw be based only on information that someone would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose. in addition.&& absent a person’s express opt-in consent you may only attempt to match your records about someone to a twitter identity based on:.&& information provided directly to you by the person. note that records about individuals with whom you have no prior relationship.&& including data about individuals obtained from third parties.&& do not meet this standard; and/or.&& public data. “public data” in this context refers to:.&& information about a person that you obtained from a public.&& generally-available resource (such as a directory of members of a professional association).&& information on twitter about a person that is publicly available.&& including:.&& tweets.&& profile information.&& including an account bio and publicly-stated location.&& display name and @handle.&& you must display your service’s privacy policy to people before they are permitted to

that information (including with twitter).&& how people can contact you with inquiries and requests regarding their information.&& your privacy policy must be consistent with all applicable laws.&& and be no less protective of people than twitter’s privacy policy and the privacy policy of our other services and corporate affiliates. you must cease your access to the twitter api and the use of all twitter content if you are unable to comply with your and/or twitter’s privacy policy..&& use of geo data comes with additional restrictions due to the sensitive nature of this information. if your service adds location information to tweets or periscope broadcasts.&& you must disclose to people:.&& when you add location information.&& whether you add location information as a geotag or annotations data.&& whether your location information is listed as a place.&& or as geographic coordinates.&& if your application allows people to tweet with their location you must comply with twitter’s geo guidelines in full. .&& any use of location data or geographic information on a standalone basis is prohibited. you may not (and may not permit others to) store.&& aggregate.&& or cache location data and other geographic information contained in twitter content.&& except as part of a tweet or periscope broadcast. for example.&& you may not separate location data or geographic information out from tweets to show where individuals have been over time. heat maps and related tools that show aggregated geo activity (e.g.: the number of people in a city using a hashtag) are permitted..&& you may not store twitter passwords.&& or request that people provide their twitter password.&& account credentials.&& or developer application information (including consumer key) to you directly. we suggest the use of sign-in with twitter as the authentication tool to link your service and people on twitter..&& chapter 3.&& have you taken care to review twitter’s policies and set up your api access the right way? does your service follow twitter’s privacy and control guidelines? if you can answer yes to these two questions.&& then you are ready to start using the twitter api and twitter content. twitter’s platform usage guidelines provide the assistance needed to ensure that your use of twitter content is compliant from day 1 throughout the lifecycle of your service. we suggest reviewing these rules on a regular basis to make sure that your integration is operating in a way that is safe and beneficial to people on twitter and the twitter platform as a whole..&& the
