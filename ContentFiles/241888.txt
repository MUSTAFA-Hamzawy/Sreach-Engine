[innovations in health information from the director of the national library of medicine.&& this blog post is by lyric jorgenson.&& phd.&& the acting director of the nih office of science policy. it was originally posted on may 12 on the nih office of science policy under the poliscope blog. we encourage you to read it and submit comments and feedback on the draft supplemental information to the nih policy for data management and sharing: protecting privacy when sharing human research participant data by june 27..&& sequels are all the rage these days.  i figure if marvel can make endless “avengers” movies.&& i could start making blog sequels.  back in the beginning of the year.&& i wrote part i of this blog series about how nih is working to implement the new nih data management and sharing policy (dms policy).  i mentioned at that time that additional resources were forthcoming..&& i should note that when we started to receive comments on what was to become the nih dms policy.&& one thing in particular stood out to us.  many commentors told us it would be helpful to have clear information on how to protect the privacy and respect the autonomy of participants when sharing data.  now.&& we all know that cliffhangers build anticipation.&& so without further delay.&& i want to share with you some of the tools nih has been working on to answer that call..&& first.&& if you have seen the avengers movies.&& you likely will have noticed that they tend to introduce a new villain that the team needs to battle with either new tools (think of osp with thor’s stormbreaker axe) or the help of new superheroes like captain marvel. while not exactly a new villain.&& the lack of consistent consent language to facilitate secondary research with data and biospecimens is certainly a challenge many of our stakeholders have raised and one that we thought we could help address..&& nih has a long history of developing consent language and.&& as such.&& our team worked across the agency – and with you! – to develop a new resource that shares best practices for developing informed consents to facilitate data/biospecimen storage and sharing for future use.  it also provides modifiable sample language that investigators and irbs can use to assist in the clear communication of potential risks and benefits associated with data/biospecimen storage and sharing.  in developing this resource.&& we engaged with key federal partners.&& as well as scientific societies and associations.  importantly.&& we also considered the 102 comments from stakeholders in response to a rfi that we issued in 2021..&& as for our second resource.&& we are requesting public comment on protecting the privacy of research participants when data is shared. i think i need to be upfront and acknowledge that we have issued many of these types of requests over the last several months and nih understands the effort that folks take to thoughtfully respond.  with that said.&& we think the research community will greatly benefit from this resource and we want to hear your thoughts on whether it hits the mark or needs adjustment..&& when reviewing the document.&& please bear in mind that the main purpose is to provide researchers with information on:.&& comments on the draft will be accepted until june 27.&& 2022.&& and full information and how to submit a comment can be found here..&& finally.&& every sequel needs a twist ending! in november 2021.&& nih published a request for comments on the future directions of the nih genomic data sharing policy.  we are still reviewing the many points and perspectives that were raised.&& but while we consider next steps.&& the comments we received are now available on the osp website.  okay.&& so maybe that twist wasn’t as big as.&& say.&& darth vader revealing he is (spoiler alert) luke’s father in the empire strikes back.&& but it’s still pretty good for the science policy world..&& with a little more than half a year left until the implementation date of the nih dms policy.&& we will continue to provide updates and resources over the next several months..&& right now.&& i am reading the midnight library by matt haig. it’s a fanciful story of a woman in limbo between life and death who finds herself in a magical library.&& and each book represents one of the lives she could have lived had she made even one tiny different decision. she then finds herself in many of these lives.&& experiencing what could have been..&& this book got me thinking about how nlm helps people experience lives that could be. i see this on two levels:.&& the first is the scientific pathway: what if . . . ? what if we knew more about the interactions between evolutionary forces and molecular constraints (like the work of aravind iyer.&& phd).&& or fully appreciated the potential of proteins for genome engineering (like the discoveries made by eugene koonin.&& phd).&& or could envision how and why proteins fold or switch their folds (as explored by lauren porter.&& phd).&& or had the power to enable machines to understand human thought (like the research from dina demner-fushman.&& md.&& phd). in addition to the discoveries by our nlm intramural researchers.&& our vast literature and data repositories hold answers that could change lives: why some genetic structures lead to human characteristics.&& or why a certain biochemical compound helps prevent infection. we help scientists discover these pathways and connections by providing them with the tools to uncover what could be..&& the second is how nlm helps people see their what if using the amazing richness of the resources that we make available through our collections. our resources—which encompass clinical insights.&& medical information.&& care guidelines.&& and self-management—help clinicians determine how to care for people with complex diseases or diagnose an illness in a timely manner. our repository of clinical information available through pubmed ensures that those in need can access well-reasoned.&& recognized guiding principles for their care.&& and our medlineplus web resource provides patients and their families and friends with reliable.&& up-to-date health information to support and encourage healthy behavioral changes..&& as in the midnight library.&& books alone do not inspire discovery.&& guide clinical care.&& or inform self-management. in haig’s novel.&& a fictional librarian who knows the collection shows the main character how to select books by carefully listening to her goals and needs. it is the main character’s engagement with the books that helps her explore the lives she could have lived. at nlm.&& we too have librarians—located in bethesda.&& maryland.&& and around the country through nlm’s network of the national library of medicine—who organize the library’s collections and guide patrons toward the best choice of resources. our resources must be findable.&& accessible.&& interoperable.&& reusable.&& and actionable! and then.&& the person—scientist.&& clinician.&& patient—must actively engage with the material..&& as we approach the future of data-powered health.&& guided by the nlm strategic plan (2017-2027).&& we will fulfill our mission to collect biomedical literature.&& organize it.&& preserve it.&& and make it accessible to the world. as the knowledge of health and biomedicine continues to grow faster than we can process.&& we will turn our attention to applying emerging tools.&& including machine learning and artificial intelligence.&& to make it easier to find our materials and more efficient to examine them. through our extramural programs.&& we will continue to stimulate new ways of presenting information to scientists.&& clinicians.&& patients.&& and the public so they can explore possible lives to be lived and test out their promise of better health for society. what lives can we help you explore?.&& every year.&& we celebrate national nurses week between may 6.&& which is national nurses day.&& and may 12.&& which happens to be florence nightingale’s birthday. if you haven’t picked up a specialty journal or public newspaper in the past few months.&& you may not know that nursing has made it to the headlines:.&& some of us might argue that any press is better than none.&& and others might say it’s about time that the real story about nurses and nursing become better known. while i believe a little in both perspectives.&& the real reason i’m glad to see them today is that they depict a much richer.&& more valid.&& and more robust story about who and what nurses are and how they serve society..&& a recent article in the new york times stated.&& “a shrinking band of southern nurses.&& neck deep in another covid wave.” this news story brings into national view the importance of small.&& nonprofit safety-net hospitals and the experience of the nurses who work there. told without romanticizing nurses’ dedication or pointing out their long-suffering compassionate nature.&& this article tells of the real challenges faced by nurses who want to do good for their communities but are faced with persistent shortages.&& significant illnesses that could have been avoided.&& and politically motivated.&& bureaucratic financial decisions. however.&& it also tells of the creative problem solving demonstrated by these nurses as they try to meet patient needs and the compassion they provide to their colleagues as they continue.&& yet another day.&& to address the needs of many with fewer and fewer resources..&& look at the first three headlines: together.&& these depict a professional field dedicated to meeting the conditions of its social contract—to provide high-quality patient care—and awash with opportunities for outstanding career growth.&& and at the same time at risk of losing some of its critical workforce due to unrelenting stress in the workplace. what does this say about nursing? never has there been such opportunity.&& but never has the opportunity promised so little..&& a beautiful story in march in the new york times.&& “confronting grief.&& with margaret atwood.&& in ‘the nurse antigone.&&’” which talks about regular nurses participating with margaret atwood in the reading of the play antigone.&& provides me with hope and vision. in this rendition.&& atwood will play the blind prophet theophanes and the nurses will be part of the greek chorus. this story of antigone’s determination to bury her brother.&& who died in battle.&& despite a law forbidding the burial of traitors mirrors the challenges nurses face by attending to those in need despite enormous challenges in acquiring resources needed to provide care.&& including sufficient time. an ethicist quoted in the article remarks that antigone’s triumph over creon’s prohibitions provides an apt mirror of the moral injury with which nurses cope.&& neither romanticizing their decision nor despairing at their deplorable conditions..&& the final headline in the middle of the pack heralds nurses’ awakening to their economic power. the covid-19 pandemic didn’t create the traveling nurse sector of our profession.&& but it certainly accelerated its growth across the country. individual remuneration soared.&& leaving many nurses with the dilemma to remain as a loyal worker in a long-served institution or move on for financial gain. hospitals too faced the challenge of differential staff compensation.&& with highly paid traveling nurse staff working next to more modestly paid existing staff. fortunately.&& the perversity of this economic structure has led to hospitals and clinics improving staff nurse compensation.&& attending to their work conditions.&& and stabilizing the staffing complement..&& as we celebrate national nurses week this year.&& please join me in recognizing the vibrant.&& rich picture of our profession. we are not unbuffered by these challenging times.&& and as a profession.&& we are responding in a way that serves our patients while preserving our profession. accepting new models of care.&& innovative career trajectories.&& and an expanded understanding of how to create compassionate workplaces promises a future in which all nurses can work to the top of their licenses. let us know how we can help you do this.&& too!.&& guest post by amanda j. wilson.&& chief of the nlm office of engagement and training (oet).&& and dianne babski.&& associate director for library operations..&& nlm is excited to participate in the annual medical

to two researchers from our intramural research program (irp).&& dr. lauren porter and dr. xiaofang jiang..&& now i would like you to meet another one of our researchers.&& l. aravind iyer.&& phd. a member of the nlm irp.&& dr. iyer is a senior investigator in the computational biology branch of the national center for biotechnology information. his research revolves around uncovering the stories and patterns held within dna and rna and is aimed at unraveling the evolutionary forces that shape biochemical functioning and biological form..&& just like any other biological structure.&& dna and rna evolve over time.&& which can tell a complex story of an organism’s past and illustrate relationships between organisms that aren’t obvious..&& see the infographic below to learn more about the exciting research happening in dr. iyer’s lab..&& now.&& in his own words.&& learn more about the man behind the research!.&& what do you enjoy about working at nlm? nlm is one of the world’s leading centers (such can be counted on one’s fingers) for deciphering the biochemistry and biology of proteins through computational analysis of sequences and structures. as a national lab.&& it has an organizational structure and funding framework best suited for the kind of research that i do.&& which involves an extensive explorative component. what makes your team unique? my team embodies a considerable mass of special knowledge regarding protein evolution and function that we accumulated and systematized over a period of several decades. given that we look at this using various computational methods.&& my team melds the expertise of people well versed in biology.&& computer programming.&& biochemistry.&& protein structure.&& and graph-theoretic analysis. what is your advice for young scientists or people interested in pursuing a career in research? i think the most interesting discoveries are those that bring together and illuminate disparate areas of inquiry. hence.&& spend your early youth acquiring a very diverse knowledge base and technical capacity. then organize this knowledge into an interconnected network that you can train your intuition on and draw from when confronted with new problems. when you’re not in the lab.&& what do you enjoy doing? amateur astronomy.&& reading and writing about history and ancient texts in the original or translations.&& recreational mathematics.&& storytelling. what inspires you? lives of past scientists.&& philosophers.&& and leaders from around the world. the profound insights found in the works of the ancients..&& you’ve read his words.&& but now you can hear them for yourself. follow along on the nlm youtube page for more exciting content from the nlm staff that makes it all possible. if you’d like to learn more about our irp program.&& view job opportunities.&& and explore research highlights.&& i invite you to explore the newly redesigned nlm irp webpage..&& .&& video transcript.&& [iyer] early in my life.&& i wanted to be a paleontologist. and that’s what actually led me to molecular biology. at one level.&& i could say that i wish to understand the whole protein universe. proteins can be divided into evolutionary units. there’s a part of a protein that’s preserved over evolution because natural selection is maintaining that part for some reason. and one realization.&& which dawned on us starting around the early nineties—and this was a very profound realization for all of biology—is that there is a relatively small number of these evolutionary units of proteins.&& which we term domains.&& which constitutes the entire protein universe of all organisms across the tree of life..&& if we can understand the functions of these units.&& then that goes a long way towards understanding what organisms do. and given there are many gaps in our understanding of what organisms do.&& one way to get at it is to first.&& find all these domains. the second aspect of it is predicting functions for them. the first phase of my research.&& we captured most of the low-hanging fruit.&& which were the big families conserved across all organisms..&& now we are moving on to the more difficult terrain.&& but the difficult terrain also holds a lot of promise because many un-understood functions are hiding within that difficult terrain.&& and it gives these offshoots in the form of biotechnological reagents. there are things like restriction enzymes.&& the crispr systems.&& and dna modification systems. all of these have become very popular reagents..&& nlm is a world leader in the analysis of protein sequences.&& protein structures.&& and inferring evolution from these bits of information. and this has been a very long-standing interest of mine so.&& this is the
