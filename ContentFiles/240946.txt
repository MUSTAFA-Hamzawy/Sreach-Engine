periodically, but the plugin won’t consider it broken unless it gets a new result., «dismiss» hides the link from the «broken links» and «redirects» views. it will still be checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. a strike-through effect for broken links), but won’t be reported again unless its status changes. useful if you want to acknowledge a link as broken/redirected and just

the max download size to 5 kb when using snoopy., fixed a rare bug where the settings page would redirect to the login screen when saving settings., removed some stale, unused code (some still remains)., fixed a sql query that had the table prefix hard-coded as «wp_». this would previously make the plugin detect zero links on sites that have a different table prefix., fix a bug when the plugin creates a db table with the wrong prefix., this is a near-complete rewrite with a lot of new features., see �http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/05/22/broken-link-checker-05/ for details., fix false positives when the url contains an #anchor, (hopefully) fix join() failure when snoopy doesn’t return any http headers., there are no release notes for this version, set the referer header to blog’s home address when checking a link. this should help deal with some bot traps., i know, i know – there haven’t been any major updates for a while. but there will be eventually 🙂, fix sql error when a post is deleted., changed required access caps for «manage -> broken links» from manage_options to edit_ohers_posts. this will allow editor users to access that page and it’s functions., link sorting, somewhat experimental., javascript sorting feature for the broken link list., curl isn’t required anymore. snoopy is used when curl isn’t available., post title in broken link list is now a link to the post (permalink). consequently, removed «view» button., added a «details» link. clicking it will show/hide more info about the reported link., «unlink» and «edit» now work for images, too. «unlink» simply removes the image., database modifications to enable the changes described above., moved the url checking function from wsblc_ajax.php to broken-link-checker.php; made it more flexible., new and improved (tm) regexps for finding links and images., a «settings» link added to plugin’s action links., and probably other stuff i forgot!, grr 😛, minor enhancements :, autoselect link url after the user clicks «edit»., make sure only http and https links are checked., more substantive improvements will hopefully follow next week., minor compatibility enhancement in wsblc_ajax.php – don’t load wpdb if it’s already loaded., bugfixes. nothing more, nothing less., revisions don’t get added to the work queue anymore., workaround for rare curl timeout bug., improved wp 2.6 compatibility., correctly handle urls containing a single quote ‹., consider a http 401 response ok. such links won’t be marked as broken anymore., fix : don’t check links in revisions, only posts/pages., there are no release notes for this version, split translated version from the previous code. was causing weird problems., there are no release notes for this version, added localization support (may be buggy)., fix : use get_permalink to get the «view» link. old behavior was to use the guid., edit broken links @ manage -> broken links (experimental), change: a bit more verbose db error reporting for the «unlink» feature., switch from wp_print_scripts() to wp_enqueue_script(), wp_enqueue_script(), new: «delete post» option., new: increase the compatibility number., change:
