[data analytics throws complex scenarios where the data need to be wrangled to moved around. in this context let’s see how we can take a big list and split it into many sublists as per the requirement. in this article we will explore the approaches to achieve this..&& in this approach we use list dicing to get the elements from the point at which the splitting has to happen. then we use zip and for loop to create the sublists using a for loop..&&  live demo.&& running the above code gives us the following result −.&& the chain function makes an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is exhausted. so it marks the points where the splitting happens. then we use the zip function to package the result of splitting into sublists..&&  live demo.&& running the above code gives us the following result −.&& .&& we make use of cookies to improve our user experience. by using this website.&& you agree with our cookies policy. agree learn more][custom list split in python, with zip and for loop, example, output, using chain and zip, example, output]custom list split in python[][java jsp ios html android python c programming c++ programming c# php css javascript jquery sap sap hana data structure rdbms mysql mathematics 8085 microprocessor operating system digital electronics analysis of algorithms mobile development front end web development selenium mongodb computer network general topics, java, jsp, ios, html, android, python, c programming, c++ programming, c#, php, css, javascript, jquery, sap, sap hana, data structure, rdbms, mysql, mathematics, 8085 microprocessor, operating system, digital electronics, analysis of algorithms, mobile development, front end, web development, selenium, mongodb, computer network, general topics, library, ebooks, courses, trending categories, data structure, networking, rdbms, operating system, java, ios, html, css, android, python, c programming, c++, c#, mongodb, mysql, javascript, php, selected reading, upsc ias exams notes, developers best practices, questions and answers, effective resume writing, hr interview questions, computer glossary, who is who, related questions & answers, python - convert list to custom overlapping nested list, split list in c++, custom multiplication in list of lists in python, custom sorting in list of tuples in python, python – custom lower bound a list, python - custom space size padding in strings list, python – split list on next larger value, python - split list into all possible tuple pairs, python program to remove row with custom list element, how do you split a list into evenly sized chunks in python?, custom len() function in python, custom length matrix in python, how to implement a custom python exception with custom message?, recursive approach for alternating split of linked list in c++, java program to split a list into two halves, print,  add notes,  bookmark this page,  report error,  suggestions, about us, terms of use, cookies policy, faqs, helping, contact]
