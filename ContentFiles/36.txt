[about | contact| advertise.&& .&& .&& a microcontroller uses many different protocols to communicate with various sensors and modules. there are many different types of communication protocols for wireless and wired communication.&& and the most commonly used communication technique is serial communication. serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time.&& sequentially.&& over a communication channel or bus. there are many types of serial communication like uart.&& can.&& usb.&& i2c.&& and spi communication..&&  .&& in this tutorial.&& we learn about the spi protocol and how to use it in arduino. we will use spi protocol for communication between two arduinos. here one arduino will act as master and another one will act as slave.&& two leds and push buttons will be connected to both the arduino. to demonstrate spi communication.&& we will control the master side led by the push button at the slave side and vice versa using the spi serial communication protocol..&& important note: a new resolution is underway to improve the terminologies used in spi communication by removing office words like master and slave while discussing spi communication. according to this new resolution.&& people are encouraged to use the word controller in place of master and peripheral in place of slave. it is expected that the terms mosi/miso and ss will be changed to sdi(serial data in) /sdo(serial data out)and cs(chip select) respectively. for the sake of avoiding confusion.&& we have still used the old terminologies in the article.&& but we encourage our readers to practise the new terms. .&& spi (serial peripheral interface) is a serial communication protocol. spi interface was found by motorola in 1970. spi has a full-duplex connection.&& which means that the data is sent and received simultaneously. that is a master can send data to a slave and a slave can send data to the master simultaneously. spi is synchronous serial communication means the clock is required for communication purposes..&& spi communication is previously explained in other microcontrollers:.&&  .&& a spi has a master/slave communication by using four lines. a spi can have only one master and can have multiple slaves. a master is usually a microcontroller and the slaves can be a microcontroller.&& sensors.&& adc.&& dac.&& lcd etc..&& below is the block diagram representation of spi master with single slave..&& .&&  .&& spi has following four lines miso.&& mosi.&& ss.&& and clk.&&  .&& spi master with multiple slaves.&& .&& to start communication between master and slave we need to set the required devices slave select (ss) pin to low.&& so that it can communicate with the master. when its high.&& it ignores the master. this allows you to have multiple spi devices sharing the same miso.&& mosi.&& and clk lines of master. as you can see in the above image there are four slaves in which the sclk.&& miso.&& mosi are common connected to master and the ss of each slave is connected separately to individual ss pins (ss1.&& ss2.&& ss3) of master. by setting the required ss pin low a master can communicate with that slave..&&  .&& the image below shows the spi pins present arduino uno (in red box)..&& .&& spi line.&& pin in arduino.&& mosi.&& 11 or icsp-4.&& miso.&& 12 or icsp-1.&& sck.&& 13 or icsp-3.&& ss.&& 10.&&  .&& before start programming for spi communication between two arduinos. we need to learn about the arduino spi library used in arduino ide..&& the library <spi.h> is included in the program for using the following functions for spi communication. .&&  .&& 1. spi.begin().&& use: to initialize the spi bus by setting sck.&& mosi.&& and ss to outputs.&& pulling sck and mosi low.&& and ss high..&&  .&& 2. spi.setclockdivider(divider).&& use: to set the spi clock divider relative to the system clock. the available dividers are 2.&& 4.&& 8.&& 16.&& 32.&& 64 or 128..&& dividers: .&&  .&& 3. spi.attachinterrupt(handler).&& use: this function is called when a slave device receives data from the master..&&  .&& 4. spi.transfer(val).&& use: this function is used to simultaneous send and receive the data between master and slave..&&  .&& so now let’s start with practical demonstration of spi protocol in arduino. in this tutorial we will use two arduino one as master and other as slave. both arduino are attached with a led & a push button separately. master led can be controlled by using slave arduino’s push button and slave arduino’s led can be controlled by master arduino’s push button using spi communication protocol present in arduino..&&  .&&  .&& the below circuit diagram shows how to use spi on arduino uno.&& but you can follow the same procedure for arduino mega spi communication or arduino nano spi communication. almost everything will remain the same except for the pin number. you have to check the pinout of arduino nano or mega to find the arduino nano spi pins and arduino mega pins.&& once you have done that everything else will be the same. .&& .&& i have built the above-shown circuit over a breadboard.&& you can see the circuit set-up that i used for testing below. .&& .&&  .&& this tutorial has two programs one for master arduino and other for slave arduino. complete programs for both sides are given at the end of this project..&&  .&& 1. first of all we need to include the spi library for using spi communication functions..&&  .&& 2. in void setup().&&            .&&  .&&                          .&&  .&&  .&& 3. in void loop():.&&  .&&           .&&  .&&  .&& note: we use serial.println() to view the result in serial motor of arduino ide. check the video at the end..&&  .&& 1. first of all we need to include the spi library for using spi communication functions..&&                           .&& 2. in void setup().&&            .&&    .&& the above statement sets miso as output (have to send data to master in). so data is sent via miso of slave arduino..&&           .&&    .&&  .&& 3. next in void loop () we set the slave arduino led to turn on or off depending upon the slavereceived value..&&  .&&  .&& note: we use serial.println() to view the result in serial motor of arduino ide. check the video at the end..&&  .&& below is the picture of final setup for spi communication between two arduino boards..&& when push button at master side is pressed.&& white led at slave side turns on..&&  .&& and when the push button at slave side is pressed.&& red led at master side turns on..&& .&& you can check out the

submitted by thomas minnick on sun.&& 06/16/2019 - 04:40.&& hello.&& great tutorial.&&  i am going to mess with this a bit to see if it works for me.  question.  i noticed the master code uses pin10

would make me thing that the slave unit in this example would listen and respond to any and all communication on the spi without regard to the masters ss.  is this correct?  how would you correct

begin the spi communication, next we set the clockdivider for spi communication. here we have set divider 8., then set the ss pin high since we didn’t start any transfer to slave arduino., we read the status of the pushbutton pin connected to pin2 (master arduino) for sending those value to the slave arduino., set logic for setting x value (to be sent to slave) depending upon input from pin 2, before sending the value we need to low the slave select value to begin the transfer to slave from master., here comes the important step, in the following statement we send the push button value stored in mastersend variable to the slave arduino and also receive value from slave that will be store in mastereceive variable., after that depending upon the mastereceive value we will turn the master arduino led on or off., we start serial communication at baud rate 115200., attach led to pin 7 and push button to pin2 and set those pins output and input respectively., the important step here is the following statements, now turn on spi in slave mode by using spi control register, then turn on interrupt for spi communication. if a data is received from master the interrupt routine is called and the received value is taken from spdr (spi data register), the value from master is taken from spdr and stored in slavereceived variable. this takes place in following interrupt routine function., next we read the status of the slave arduino push button and store the value in slavesend to send the value to master arduino by giving value to spdr register., log in or register to post
