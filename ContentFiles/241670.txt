[reviews.&& contributor.&& for many people.&& the day can’t start without some type of coffee. and for those who not only appreciate but also worship the perfect cup.&& they look to espresso.&& which many consider coffee in its most potent form. that’s why investing in the right espresso machine is well worth the time and money. .&& “there’s an entire process behind making espresso.&&” says michelin-starred chef nicholas stefanelli of masseria and officina in washington.&& d.c. “there’s an exacting science that aids in the operation.” for some coffee aficionados.&& this espresso-brewing process is an enjoyable part of the experience..&& the science of making coffee on demand has been being refined for more than a century. “it all started in turin.&& italy.&& where angelo moriondo—the owner of the famous grand-hotel ligure—observed his customers and identified the need to prepare coffee quickly so they could enjoy it as soon as it was made.&&” explains bryce iapicca.&& director of operations at italian café puro gusto. moriondo developed a brewer that he called the “new steam machinery for the economic and instantaneous confection of coffee beverage.”.&& in the years since.&& not only has the technology improved but so has the name of the machine. .&& while an at-home espresso machine does not always include the commercial-grade bells and whistles of a restaurant machine.&& iapicca suggests being sure to purchase one with a proper coffee extraction system that can leverage water at a high temperature and with high pressure. .&& “a good quality espresso machine will maintain a consistent temperature and pressure (nine bars) during the extraction.&& which is vital when brewing espresso.&&” iapicca says. “the cheaper machines will be able to reach the nine-bar pressure but tend to fluctuate wildly.” .&& the number of bars of pressure an espresso machine attains is the measure of force at which water is being pushed through the coffee grounds. nine bars.&& or nine times standard atmospheric pressure at sea level.&& is hailed as the gold standard for espresso brewing by many.&& including italian coffee powerhouse brand illy. they advise nine bars for proper extraction.&& highlighting the risks of going below that (thin.&& weak.&& light espresso) and above it (dark.&& bitter.&& burnt espresso). .&& some espresso machines come with a wand for frothing.&& which while not totally necessary.&& can be a bonus feature. .&& to help you navigate the extensive espresso machine market.&& we’ve rounded up six of the best espresso machines that won’t
