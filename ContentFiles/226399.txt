[, golang is a procedural and statically typed programming language having the syntax similar to c programming language. sometimes it is termed as go programming language. it provides a rich standard library, garbage collection, and dynamic-typing capability. it was developed in 2007 by robert griesemer, rob pike, and ken thompson at google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language and mainly used in google’s production systems. golang is one of the most trending programming languages among developers., overview, fundamentals, control flow, functions and methods,
