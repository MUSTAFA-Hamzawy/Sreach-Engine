[ovarian cancer is highly curable if it’s diagnosed and treated early. here are the key symptoms to look for., women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer that hasn’t spread beyond the ovaries (sometimes referred to as localized or stage 1) have a five-year survival rate of 92.6 percent, per the national cancer institute. (1) but only 15.7 percent of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at the local stage, and the five-year survival rate for all stages is only 48.6 percent., one major reason for this is that early-stage ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic, according to the american cancer society. (2) when there are ovarian cancer symptoms, they can be vague or easy to blame on other, less serious conditions., unfortunately, researchers have been unsuccessful so far in their efforts to develop a reliable screening test that can detect the disease in women without ovarian cancer symptoms (in the way that a pap test can for cervical cancer and a mammogram can for breast cancer)., these issues help explain why ovarian cancer, though relatively rare, is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death in women and the most life-threatening of all cancers of the female reproductive system, according to the american cancer society.

(9), still, there are some early symptoms to watch out for, including the following:, ovarian cancer pain may be vague or noticeable. typically, the pain is felt in the pelvis, abdomen, or lower back., sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between ovarian cancer pain and gastrointestinal-related problems. pain that is new to you, does not come and go, cannot be easily attributed to other factors or conditions, and lasts for more than three weeks can all be signs of a problem., usually, the more the cancer spreads in the body, the more intense and constant the pain becomes, notes the american cancer society. (10), if you report any of these physical changes to your doctor, they will likely ask you a series of questions about your symptoms — when they started, how long you’ve had them — as well as about any history of cancer in your family and other risk factors, per the american cancer society. (11), your doctor may perform a pelvic exam as well as other screening tests for ovarian cancer including transvaginal ultrasound and blood tests. (2), if there is a reason to suspect you may have ovarian cancer, the doctor will likely refer you to a specialist called a gynecologic oncologist — a doctor with special training in cancers of the female reproductive system., there is evidence that treatment by a specialist helps patients with ovarian cancer live longer, according to an article published in january 2016 in frontiers in oncology. (12), additional reporting by julie marks and leona vaughn., by subscribing you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy., pain from ovarian cancer can be subtle or extensive, but there are pain management strategies that can help., it’s important to know your ovarian cancer risk when family planning and how a prior diagnosis can affect fertility., effective ovarian cancer treatment requires a cooperative approach. learn about the key healthcare providers who should be on your team., whether you’re in the middle of treatment for ovarian cancer or trying to get your strength back after you’ve completed it, a yoga routine may be just..., new treatments for advanced ovarian cancer are helping some women defy the odds. here’s how one 78-year-old and her doctors have kept hope alive for a..., a pelvic exam is usually the first step, followed by blood tests, imaging tests, and surgery., treated at its earliest stage, ovarian cancer has a high survival rate. but women and their doctors often fail to recognize the symptoms, leading to missed..., by subscribing you agree to the terms of use and privacy policy.][ovarian cancer: what are the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer?, most recent in ovarian cancer, finding a cancer diagnosis and coping with infertility, what is ovarian cancer?
