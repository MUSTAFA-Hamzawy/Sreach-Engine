[system design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements. system design for tech interviews is something that can’t be ignored! almost every it giant whether it be facebook, amazon, google, or any other ask various questions based on system design concepts such as scalability, load-balancing, caching, etc. in the interview. this specifically designed system design tutorial will help you to learn and master system design concepts in the most efficient way from basics to advanced level.  , , , , want to get a software developer/engineer job at a leading tech company? or want to make a smooth transition from sde i to sde ii or senior developer profiles? if yes, then you’re required to dive deep into the system design world! a decent command over system design concepts is very much essential, especially for the working professionals, to get a much-needed advantage over others during tech interviews., and that’s why, geeksforgeeks is providing you with an in-depth interview-centric system design – live course that will help you prepare for the questions related to system designs for google, amazon, adobe, uber, and other product-based companies., writing code in comment? please use ide.geeksforgeeks.org, generate link and share the link here.][related articles, table of contents, system design
