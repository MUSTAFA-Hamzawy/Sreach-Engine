[the lottery is a random game, but mathematically, you can predict it to an extent.  probability theory can, indeed, pose as an effective guide in predicting how the lottery behaves.  then, along with lottery prediction, you can pick a better number combination with the best shot at the lottery, firstly, it is important that i introduce some basic mathematical concepts to you. but don’t worry! you don’t need a math degree to understand the lottery formula., let’s start., firstly, the binomial coefficients formula or the combination formula which is used to compute the number of possible combinations in a given set., , the second is the probability formula which is used to compute how likely an event is to happen. in the lottery, it is used to calculate the likelihood of a set of numbers occurrence., , the two lottery formulas are essential to understanding the odds of winning in various lotteries in the world., firstly, let’s discuss the primary application of the above formulas then we proceed on how to use the same to predict the lottery., n = 69, r = 5, ncr = (69/5)(68/4)(67/3)(66/2)(65/1), = 11,238,513, in powerball, winning the jackpot requires matching the extra ball, in this case, the total combination becomes:, possible combinations in powerball = 292,201,338, if a represents one of the combinations, then:, p(a) = 1/292,201,338 or 0.0000000034222978130237, therefore, the odds of winning the powerball is 1 in 292,201,338., considering the astronomical odds of winning, you likely think it is impossible to win with any lottery numbers you can think of., but, hang on, there’s more to the lottery than meets the eye., we can use the same formula to predict the lottery.  let’s continue., in the mega millions, the odds of winning are 1 in 259 million and the odds for us powerball are a staggering 1 in 292 million., let’s take a look at the odds of other lotteries:, looking at those odds, you’re more likely to be killed by an asteroid (1 in 700,000), be struck by lightning while drowning (1 in 183 million) or give birth to quadruplets (1 in 729,000) according to a cnn article., of course, in probability, if you do not play the lottery, your chances of winning reduce to zero or impossible., so this is the problem with playing the lottery in a classical approach. players look at the odds based on the individual combination., you won’t win the lottery if you keep looking at the lottery one-sidedly. you must learn how to pick lottery numbers from a different perspective., so if looking at the lottery one-sidedly does not help you win, then what does?, the answer lies in the way you pick numbers., by digging deeply into the discrete structure of lottery numbers, you will find certain “types of combinations” that will give you the key on how to win., enter gianella’s template., renato gianella is a brazilian mathematician who published a study called the geometry of chance in 2013., in gianella’s study, he claimed that number combinations do not have the same probability. gianella’s theory involves dividing the numbers into color groups and forming combinations based on color patterns which he called “templates.”, according to gianella, to increase your chances of winning, you must play the lottery using “template” that have a high probability of getting drawn., using this template you can predict the best, the not so bad and the worst combination patterns in the lottery., a similar study conducted by edvin hiltner confirmed gianella’s theory., let’s discuss now how to determine these powerful templates or patterns., we use math., fortunately, the formula to use is the same in any lottery.  we simply change the variable depending on the format. so the 5/69 powerball have different probability analysis compared to 5/59 eurojackpot or 5/75 mega millions., to apply math in the lottery; first, we get the probability of each pattern.  then, we multiply the probability with the number of draws to get its predicted frequency or in simple terms, the “estimated occurrence.”, estimated occurrence = probability x number of draws, according to the law of large numbers, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed to infinity., therefore, to prove that our recommendation of playing the lottery based on patterns is correct, our estimation should be close to the actual results, given a sufficiently large number of data from actual lottery draws., estimated occurrence is equal or close to actual occurrence, so without further ado, let’s go to the confirmation part of this article., enter actual lottery results., probability will always be a means to put a solid number on our lottery prediction scientifically and mathematically. it’s a guide on how events will turn out eventually., so let’s see how lottery prediction matches with actual lottery results., please notice the closeness between the estimated values and the actual occurrences., , click here for the complete analysis, there are 210 patterns in australian saturday lotto.  it’s impossible to list them all here, but for the complete list and full descriptions, please click here., as you can see from the table of australian lottery of 583 draws, the “estimated occurrence” and “actual occurrence” match extremely close., pattern 1 is estimated to occur about 17 times in 583 draws.  the actual lottery results show 14., no. 3 is estimated to appear about 17 times in 583 draws.  the actual draws show 18., the rest of the patterns show similar accuracy in estimation and actual appearances., therefore, this proves that combination patterns exhibit different probabilities which are instrumental in lottery prediction., the table indicates that your best lottery strategy is to pick lottery numbers based on pattern 1.  however, there are 210 patterns in australian tattslotto 6/45 lottery, and it’s impossible to list down all of them here., now let’s see from other lotteries., , click here for the complete analysis and full descriptions of the patterns, similarly, the table above shows that the estimated occurrence tab matches extremely close with the actual occurrence., in euromillions, pattern 187, 192, and 196 are estimated that they will never appear. the actual draw indeed shows no occurrence of the said patterns., pattern 1 is estimated to occur 41 times and the actual draws show 42 occurrences., as a player of euromillions, you should know how to pick lotto numbers based on the right pattern?  this is why it is very important to use gianella’s probability theory before you play the lottery., now that we’ve proven that the lottery exhibits different patterns with different probabilities, this gives us a way to predict how the lottery behaves on a sufficiently large number of lottery draws., let’s go first with the new powerball 5/69 lottery game., , click here for the complete powerball analysis, for lack of enough space, we can only provide ten items here at the most., the table above shows patterns 417 and 462 are the worst ones to play for the us powerball because you will only waste your money as they will never appear in any draw., there are 301 worst combination patterns in us powerball.  unfortunately, the majority of the powerball players are not aware that they use these worst ones to pick lottery numbers.  you are probably one of them., clearly, there are two major reasons why it is important to know your lottery patterns:, to have higher chances of winning the u.s. powerball, you should focus your playing strategy on six best patterns., , click here for the irish lotto analysis, the lottery prediction table above shows the huge difference between patterns 1 and 210., if you are an irish lottery player, are you willing to waste money on 199 or 210?, the problem, the majority of lottery players never know they are falling into lottery numbers that will never appear in an irish lottery.  i can almost guarantee, you are probably one of these players., the irish lottery has 210 total patterns but only three are the best., , click here for the uk lotto analysis, the above table shows that patterns 434 and 462 will not appear.  if you were to play the uk lottery, you will not want to waste your money with these kinds of patterns.  will you?, uk lotto has only one best pattern.  there are 30 patterns that are not so good and 431 that are worst., what’s the guarantee you are not picking lotto numbers based on these 431 worst combinations?, as i said, the same formula can be used for all lotteries., the lotterycodex has a dedicated website about probability for all the lotteries in the world., conclusion:, to win the lottery, you have to select numbers like a mathematician., it’s time to know how to win the lottery according to math. you must stop picking lottery numbers based on the bad combination.  instead, you should focus on combination patterns that will give you the best chances of winning.][lifetickler, lottery prediction according
