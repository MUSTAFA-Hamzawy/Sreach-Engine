[by paul adams bbc news.&& is the russian military having to change its plans? perhaps even reduce the scale of moscows ambitions in ukraine?.&& its probably too early to tell.&& but theres definitely a shift in emphasis..&& a top russian general - sergey rudskoy - says the first stage of what president vladimir putin calls russias special military operation has been mostly accomplished and that russian forces will now concentrate on the complete liberation of the donbas..&& this is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the line of contact that separates ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the russian-backed separatist peoples republics of donetsk and luhansk..&& the pace of russias advance in other areas of ukraine remains glacial. its forces have been pushed back from positions around the capital.&& kyiv.&& and are said to have started digging defensive positions to avoid losing more or prepare for some kind of pause..&& its probably way too early to conclude that russia has given up on capturing kyiv.&& but western officials say that russia continues to experience setback after setback..&& on friday.&& they said russia had lost another general - the seventh - and that morale was at rock bottom in some units..&& they believe general rudskoys announcement implies that moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed..&& russia is recognising that it cant pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously.&& one official said..&& as many as 10 new russian battalion tactical groups are being generated.&& officials say.&& and are heading for the donbas..&& even before the war began last month.&& they voiced the fear that russia would make a concerted effort to encircle and envelop ukraines best fighting units which make up the joint forces operation (jfo).&& stationed along the line of contact..&& a renewed push now could see russian troops pushing out into so-far unconquered areas of donetsk and luhansk.&& possibly aiming to link up with forces moving south from kharkiv and izyum..&& and if russia can succeed in finally pacifying the port of mariupol.&& on the sea of azov.&& then other forces could move north and complete the encirclement of the jfo..&& some of these objectives still seem out of reach. mariupols defenders are putting up a ferocious fight.&& preventing russia from fully achieving another of its pre-war ambitions - a land bridge from the crimean peninsula to the donbas..&& but if moscow has concluded that it makes more sense to concentrate.&& for the time being.&& on achieving one objective at a time.&& its likely to concentrate its firepower.&& especially from the air..&& the ukrainian military.&& disciplined and motivated as it is.&& will need all the help it can get to withstand the pressure..&& i hope thats where the western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to ukrainian forces.&& one western official said..&& if the coming days do see a shift of focus to the donbas.&& that doesnt yet mean that moscow has abandoned its wider ambitions..&& we dont see a re-evaluation of the invasion as a whole.&& a senior us defence official said..&& this video can not be played.&& why mariupol is so important to russias plan.&& how one woman survived a 500kg bomb attack.&& nearly 1.&&000 fighters have left mariupol steelworks - russia.&& mariupol: 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruins.&& russian soldier pleads guilty in war crimes trial.&& mariupol: 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruins.&& the police officer who lost his family in one strike.&& the secret girls school defying the taliban.&& chinas silenced feminist: how a journalist went missing. videochinas silenced feminist: how a journalist went missing.&& a simple guide to australias election.&& how buffalo fits the new pattern of far-right terror.&& the french macaron shrouded in secrecy.&& the batteries powered by gravity.&& my picture was used to spread lies about the war.&& the giant deep-earth blobs baffling scientists.&& theyre among the planets largest structures – and theyre a total mystery.&& the cities turning offices into luxury apartments.&& office buildings are ghost towns.&& so high-end apartments are taking their place.&& an unorthodox way to eat pizza.&& a century ago.&& italian immigrants in argentinas capital gave pizza an unusual new topping.&& © 2022 bbc. the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites. read about our approach to external linking.][war in ukraine: change of emphasis or admission of failure by moscow?, retreat may not mean tame ambitions, russian advances in the east, war in ukraine: more coverage, to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser., more on this story, related topics, top stories, features, elsewhere on the bbc, most read, bbc news services]war in ukraine: change of emphasis or admission of failure by moscow?
