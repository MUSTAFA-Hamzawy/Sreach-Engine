[july 09.&& 2019.&& recently at google i/o.&& we gave you a sneak peek at our new local home sdk.&& a suite of local technologies to enhance your smart home integrations. today.&& the sdk is live as a developer preview. weve been working hard testing the platform with our partners.&& including ge.&& lifx.&& philips hue.&& tp-link.&& and wemo.&& and are excited to bring you these additional technologies for connecting smart devices to the google assistant..&& .&& figure 1: the local execution path.&& .&& .&& this sdk enables developers to more deeply integrate their smart devices into the assistant by building upon the existing smart home platform to create a local execution path via google home smart speakers and nest smart displays. developers can now run their business logic to control new and existing smart devices in javascript that executes on the smart speakers and displays.&& benefitting users with reduced latency and higher reliability..&& the sdk introduces two new intents.&& identify and reachable_devices. the local home platform scans the users home network via mdns.&& udp.&& or upnp to discover any smart devices connected to the assistant.&& and triggers identify to verify that the device ids match those returned from the familiar smart home api sync intent. if the detected device is a hub or bridge.&& reachable_devices is triggered and treats the hub as the proxy device for communicating locally. once the local execution path from google home to a device is established.&& the device properties are updated in home graph..&& .&& .&& .&& figure 2: the intents used for each execution path.&& .&& when a user triggers a smart home action that has a local execution path.&& the assistant sends the execute intent to the google nest device rather than the developers cloud fulfillment. the developers javascript app is invoked.&& which then triggers the local home sdk to send control commands to the smart device over tcp.&& udp socket.&& or http/https requests. by defaulting to local execution rather than the cloud.&& users experience faster fulfillment of their requests. the execution requests can still be sent to the cloud path in case local execution fails. this redundancy minimizes the possibility of a failed request.&& and improves the overall user experience..&& additional features of the local home platform include:.&& .&& figure 3: local home configuration tool in the actions console.&& .&& javascript apps can be tested on-device.&& allowing developers to employ familiar tools like chrome developer console for debugging. because the local home sdk works with the existing smart home framework.&& you can self-certify new apps through the test suite for smart home as well..&& to learn more about the local home platform.&& check out the api reference.&& and get started adding local execution with the developer guide and samples. for general information covering how you can connect smart devices to the google assistant.&& visit the smart home documentation.&& or check out the local technologies for the smart home talk from google i/o this year..&& you can send us any feedback you have through the bug tracker.&& or engage with the community at /r/googleassistantdev. you can tag your posts with the flair local-home-sdk to help organize discussion.][developer preview of local home sdk, how it works:, get started, connect, programs, developer consoles]google developers blog: developer preview of local home sdk[][latest, get inspired, announcements, events, resources, support for all wi-fi-enabled device types and device traits without two-factor authentication enabled., no user action required to deploy local home benefits to all devices., easily configure discovery protocols and the hosted javascript app url through the actions console., connect blog facebook medium twitter youtube, blog, facebook, medium, twitter, youtube, programs women techmakers google developer groups google developers experts accelerators google developer student clubs, women techmakers, google developer groups, google developers experts, accelerators, google developer student clubs, developer consoles google api console google cloud platform console google play console firebase console actions on google console cast sdk developer console chrome web store dashboard, google api console, google cloud platform console, google play console, firebase console, actions on google console, cast sdk developer console, chrome web store dashboard, terms | privacy, sign up for the google developers newsletter subscribe]
