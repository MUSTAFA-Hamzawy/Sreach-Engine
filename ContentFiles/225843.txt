khaziev, usman shahid, tobias röding, rakesh chada, emir kapanci, pradeep natarajan naacl 2022 2022 large-scale conversational assistants such as cortana, alexa, google assistant and siri process requests through a series of modules for wake word detection, speech recognition, language understanding and response generation. an error in one of these modules can cascade through the system. given the large traffic volumes in these assistants, it is infeasible to manually analyze the data, identify requests conversational ai / natural-language processing, the impact of domain-specific representations on bert-based multi-domain spoken language understanding judith gaspers, quynh ngoc thi do, tobias röding, melanie bradford eacl workshop on domain adaptation for nlp 2021 this paper provides the first experimental study on the impact of using domain-specific representations on a bert-based multi-task spoken language understanding (slu) model for multi-domain applications. our results on a real-world dataset covering three languages indicate that by using domain-specific representations learned adversarially, model performance can be improved across all of the three slu
