[in addition to being the world’s largest medical library.&& the national library of medicine (nlm) is a leader in medical informatics and computational biology research. the nlm intramural research program (irp) directs its efforts toward two broad areas of computational biomedical sciences: 1. computational biology using biological data to advance algorithms and models to better comprehend biological systems and to connect relationships between any level of biological organization.&& and 2. computational health sciences focusing on clinical information processing.&& including new computational methods for clinical data and health data standards. nlm’s research is driven by principal investigators in the computational biology branch of the nlm’s national center for biotechnology information (ncbi-cbb) and in the computational health research branch of the lister hill national center for biomedical communications (lhncbc-chrb)..&& nlm welcomes recent doctoral graduates (ph.d..&& m.d..&& d.d.s..&& or equivalent) to apply to be postdoctoral fellows at nih. eligible u.s. citizens and permanent residents can receive an intramural research training award (irta)
