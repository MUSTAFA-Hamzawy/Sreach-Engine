http://mementoweb.org/timegate/text.html.&& the content along with the image loads correctly. however.&& i am trying to do the same on the server side.&& using c. using httpget.&& i ping the same url (written above) and it internally makes two memento requests: 1) for the text.html and 2) for the htmlimage.png file. the output for this overall request is sent back to the client. on the client side.&& the content in text.html is loaded correctly. however.&& the htmlimage.png appears missing/broken. i hope this helps. thank you for your help..&& prashantc: i still dont have enough details to

for this overall request is sent back to the client. i think were going to need to look at http traces before i can understand what youre doing. also.&& maybe we could move this discussion to the
