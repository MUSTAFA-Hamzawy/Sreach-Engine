[.&& redundancies abound in everyday speech: phrases that say the same thing twice. for example.&& two of the most common expressions that include a redundant adjective are “free gift” and “closed fist”:.&& credit cards offer free gifts to new cardholders. .&& still she came at me.&& so this time i hit her with a closed fist..&& 1. free gift a gift is a thing given willingly to someone without payment. the adjective free is redundant..&& 2. closed fist a fist is by definition a hand with the fingers folded inward toward the palm and held there tightly.&& typically in order to strike a blow or grasp something. the adjective closed is redundant..&& 3. verdant green the adjective verdant derives from a latin word meaning “green.” verdant came into english from a french word meaning “becoming green.” the english meaning of verdant is “green” or “green with vegetation.” an enthusiastic fertilizer manufacturer advertises a product that will provide the consumer with “a verdant green lawn.” either verdant or green will do..&& 4. rubicund red the adjective rubicund derives from a latin verb meaning.&& “to be red.” something that is rubicund is red or reddish. this description from fan fiction can do without one of the adjectives: “drawing rivulets of blood.&& his fingertips glowed a rubicund red.”.&& 5. overused cliché the blogger who wrote this sentence could have saved an adjective: “the overused cliché i hate the most is ‘off the beaten path.’” in reference to language.&& a cliché is an overused expression..&& 6. unexpected surprise a surprise is an unexpected occurrence. the phrase is not uncommon on the ngram viewer.&& and is frequent online:.&& an unexpected surprise greeted us upon our arrival home..&& life is full of unexpected surprises..&& a foreigner in the dining hall was an unexpected surprise..&& as “unexpectedness” is part of the definition.&& it’s enough to say that something is a surprise..&& 7. universal panacea panacea derives from a greek word meaning.&& “cure-all” and is defined in english as “a universal remedy.” because panacea contains the meaning universal.&& it’s not necessary to tack universal onto it.&& as in this sentence written by a journalist: “when henry grady was inviting northern capital south.&& we were much more certain that industrialization was the universal panacea for all economic and social ills.”.&& panacea is sufficient..&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day?

a cliche is by definition something overused.&& likewise a surprise is unexpected. how do any of these add anything to discourse except doubt that the user knows the definition of words he uses? where would you draw the line? yellow yellow-colored lemons that are yellow and yellow-colored? a hot high-temperature… wet water….&& “closed fist” was the one in particular i was thinking of. i think the repetition can reinforce the relevant aspect.&& you might be reinforcing the idea that they are not being open and welcoming.&& approaching with open hands.&& or they are not going easy on the victim by striking with open hands. yes.&& the fact of closed hands is implied in “fist” but saying it draws extra attention to the factor of interest. yes.&& “tight fist” or “clenched fist” might also serve as an appropriate modifier without the redundancy.&& but in the right context.&& i think “closed fist” sounds no worse than “cold.&& cold night.”.&& a tautology is a redundancy through and through. an “unexpected surprise” is poor use of the language and lazy writing through habitual and reflexive content creation. page fillers who love rattling on and on are the worst culprits and tend to enjoy the sound of words instead of their meaning. as a suggestion.&& instead of saying “unexpected surprise” perhaps rethink the emotion of the text and try “unexpected blessing” or even “pleasant surprise”. think before you write otherwise your meaning will skip a beat with redundancy..&& i work in a prison.&& almost every day i see a report of a fight where the combatants used.&& “closed fist punches!” it drives me nuts! a punch by definition is done with a fist. a fist by definition is a closed hand! ugh! stop it! if you want to add an adjective to a fist.&& use clenched… please!.&& .&& .&& .&& .&& copyright © 2007 - 2021 daily writing tips . all right reserved][7 redundant adjectives, keep learning! browse the style category, check our popular posts, or choose a related post below:, stop making those embarrassing mistakes! subscribe to daily writing tips today!, 9 responses to “7 redundant adjectives”, leave a comment: cancel comment, categories]7 redundant adjectives[1. free gift, 2. closed fist, 3. verdant green, 4. rubicund red, 5. overused cliché, 6. unexpected surprise, 7. universal panacea, duy k. buion march 31, 2016 11:32 am, venqaxon march 31, 2016 1:25 pm, apkon march 31, 2016 4:18 pm, venqaxon march 31, 2016 4:30 pm, andy knoedleron april 01, 2016 5:03 am, venqaxon april 01, 2016 5:00 pm, apkon april 02, 2016 3:31 pm, samon april 02, 2016 11:14 pm, krakatauon august 16, 2018 5:58 am][home, popular, 35 synonyms for “look”, email etiquette, types of plots, you will improve your english in only 5 minutes per day, guaranteed!, subscribers get access to our archives with 800+ interactive exercises!, youll also get three bonus ebooks completely free!, duy k. buion march 31, 2016 11:32 am i beg to differ on “free gifts”. there are “gifts” you only get if you take an action (buy, subscribe, whatever), and there are “free gifts” you get unconditionally. many stores are lying nowadays though that their gifts are “free” even when they are clearly not., venqaxon march 31, 2016 1:25 pm the ones i notice most involve *still* as in still remains, still lives on, still continues; and *originally* or *first* as in originally founded originally/first began, first/originally started, first/originally formed. a pet peeve of mine is capitol building. maybe too much time in dc., apkon march 31, 2016 4:18 pm i think the some of these added adjectives serve to add emphasis, and in some cases, do it quite effectively. it’s not quite repetition, but serves the same function., venqaxon march 31, 2016 4:30 pm which ones would you say are simply intensifiers and not just plain wrong?
