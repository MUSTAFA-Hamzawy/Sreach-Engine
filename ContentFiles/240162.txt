value..&& reviews:.&& “a call to arms to protect and preserve knowledge. a fine and moving book which ranges widely across time and acts as a reminder of the importance of libraries to our culture.” — wolfson history prize judges “essential reading for anyone concerned with libraries and what ovenden outlines as their role in ‘the support of democracy.&& the rule of law and open society.”―wall street journal “[burning the books] takes a nightmare that haunts many of us―the notion of the past erased―and confirms that it is no fiction but rather a recurring reality. in the process.&& ovenden stays true to his calling.&& reminding us that libraries and librarians are the keepers of humankind’s memories: without them.&& we don’t know who we are.”―jonathan freedland.&& the guardian “chronicles how libraries have served as sanctuaries for knowledge under constant threat.&& and what that means for the present and the future…shows that when knowledge in print is threatened by power.&& it’s people pledged to the printed page.&& rather than armies.&& who step in…made clear to me just how vulnerable libraries really are. when we don’t properly fund them.&& we risk lies becoming the truth.&& and the truth becoming a joke.”―slate.&& .&& the internet archive has been partnering with libraries to digitize their collections for more than 15 years. following a recent viral video featuring our book digitization efforts.&& and increased demands for e-resources.&& we’ve had renewed interest in our book scanning partnerships.&& with libraries wondering how we might be able to help them reach their patrons through digitization. join scanning center managers andrea mills and elizabeth macleod for a virtual event to learn about the ways in which the internet archive can help turn your print collections digital.&& and the impacts that these digital collections are having on remote learners..&& registration for the virtual event is free and open to the public. the live session is being offered twice to accommodate schedules and flexibility; if you are interested in joining.&& you only need to register for one session: march 24 @ 10am et / 2pm gmt march 25 @ 1pm et / 5pm gmt.&& filmmakers responded with enthusiasm and creativity to a call from the internet archive to make short films using newly available content from 1925 in celebration of public domain day. they discovered a new freedom in being able to remix film clips with greta garbo.&& magazine covers with flappers.&& and sheet music from standards like “sweet georgia brown” – all downloadable for free and reusable without restriction..&& for the contest.&& vintage images and sounds were woven into films of 2-3 minutes that conveyed a sense of whimsy.&& nostalgia.&& and humor. while some were abstract and others educational.&& they all showcased ingenuity and possibility when materials are openly available to the public..&&  “the internet archive has spent  24 years collecting and archiving content from around the world…now is the time to see what people can do with it.&&” said amir saber esfahani.&& director of special arts projects at the internet archive. he was a judge in the december short-film contest along with carey hott.&& professor of art and design at the university of san francisco.&& and brewster kahle.&& digital librarian and founder of the internet archive..&& the judges reviewed 23 entries and chose a winner based on creativity.&& variety of 1925 content (including lists of all sources).&& and fit for the event (fun.&& interesting and captivating). these new creative works may also be available for reuse.&& as indicated by the license term selected by the creator..&& joshua curry.&& a digital artist from san jose.&& won first place for his submission.&& danse des aliénés (dance of the insane).&& in which he layers pieces of film on three panes with images rising and falling music to “dance macabre” (dance of death) performed by the philadelphia symphony orchestra. the format was inspired by the poem dramatized in triptych in the short film in youth.&& beside the lonely sea.  his creation included flashes of greta garbo.&& ghosts from koko sees spooks and colorful designs flowing in and out of the frames..&& curry.&& who has been making experimental videos since the 1980s.&& says the project was a perfect fit for his artist techniques.&& where he likes to stress and transform film in new ways. his film had a glitchy.&& broken feel that is in line with the aesthetic he often uses (see his other work at lucidbeaming.com.).&& “i wanted it to be evocative and for people to appreciate it as a stand-alone piece of art.&&” says curry.&& 49. “my visual goal was to produce something challenging that a wide variety of people could connect to – despite being mostly abstract and sourced from 95-year-old content.”.&& while curry’s studio is modern and full of electronic equipment.&& working with the 1925 content and hearing music with cartoonish voices making novelty.&& popping sounds their cheeks was a welcome break. “one day when i was choosing the music.&& i was driving around the city listening to songs and felt like i was transported back in time.&&” curry says..&& he says it was also a pleasure to have easy access to the public domain content without commercial gatekeeping or legal obstacles.&& which he often encounters with digital material he wants to remix. as it happens.&& curry just completed a class in multimedia copyright. he says he works hard to operate within the rules because he wants his video creations to survive online and not be taken down because of copyright infringement allegations..&& having the works for this project in the public domain meant less time trying to get the content and more time to focus on the creative process. “it was like being a little kid who was told he couldn’t have cake and then one day saying: ‘dive in!’.&&” curry said of the access to the 1925 material in the internet archive..&& receiving the contest’s top honors was particularly meaningful.&& says curry.&& because he works in silicon valley where the internet archive has “great nerd cred” and is a library that people revere..&& “i was proud to win with weirdness.&&” curry says. “my piece was abstract.&& without narration or titles.&& and an authentic tribute to the pioneering work of the experimental films i made use of.”.&& to learn more about curry’s inspirations and to hear from him directly.&& watch the director’s commentary that was captured during the public domain day event..&& second place went to alaro brandon for vanishing ink.&& a film with a montage of clips from 16 movies including the last laugh and hold my baby and four songs: “norwegian dances.&&” “song of the vagabonds.&&” “i want to be happy” and “hawaiian ripples.”.&& arden spivack-teather.&& 12.&& and sissel ramierz.&& 13.&& both of san francisco.&& won third place for their short film.&& fashion of the 1920s. it traces the evolution of women’s clothing from tight-fitting styles that required corsets to drop-waisted.&& loose dresses popularized by flappers. “women could finally be chic and comfortable at the same time.&&” the film notes. “every time you notice a fabulous flowing frock.&& thank the 20s.”.&& arden found out about the contest through her mom.&& cari spivack.&& a staff member at the internet archive.&& and decided to partner with her friend.&& sissel.&& a classmate since kindergarten who she had collaborated with for a winning science fair project in fifth grade. on zoom and facetime.&& the girls looked through old mccalls magazines and decided to focus on the changing style of women’s clothing..&& “it was really fun to use our creativity and find things that would look good together.&&” said arden.&& who had never before made a film. although the research.&& script and editing were a challenge.&& she says she hopes to do it again..&& spivack said she enjoyed seeing her daughter explore the material in the archive.&& giggling and musing at the kitchen table about the tonics and ads she discovered. “it was exactly what i was hoping would happen — that they would be gripped by fascination of a time period that was long gone. they could travel back and learn on their own.&& paging through a magazine just like someone their age would have in 1925.”.&& the diversity of approaches people had with the films was impressive.&& added spivack..&& “it’s a good introduction to what can be done with old materials. you can use them to learn and to educate others. or you can reuse them to make something that’s completely unexpected or never seen before.&&” spivack said. “as archivists everything is important. but you don’t know why until you see what it can turn into or what it informs in the future.”.&& the films were shown at the december 17 public domain day virtual party.&& where the creators were asked to discuss their projects in breakout room discussions. you can view a livestream of the event here..&& the public domain is an invaluable component of our culture.&& allowing for the remixing.&& reinterpretation.&& and redistribution of designated works without restriction. on december 17th.&& we’ll be celebrating the works published in 1925 that will be moving into the public domain when the clock strikes

grand reopening of marygrove college library. despite the closure of the college.&& the library’s valuable collection of social justice scholarship has started a new life online. the materials are now freely available on our website.&& showcasing the power of digitization for preserving knowledge and expanding access. if you missed the session.&& you can watch the recording or read a full recap. .&& the conference was packed with insight into the impact of controlled digital lending on libraries and the communities they serve. in our policy session.&& experts discussed how to build a healthy information ecosystem for the 21st century. our community session gave a platform to librarians.&& educators.&& and technologists who are developing next-generation library tools. .&& the discussions showed a library community deeply committed to digital innovation and its potential for creating a more equal society. a key theme was how covid-19 lockdowns have made librarians more aware of the necessity of digital lending. the practice.&& always useful in reaching communities who cannot access physical books.&& has been shown a powerful tool in emergency response. practitioners also placed emphasis on the key role of digitization in archiving knowledge for future generations. .&& however.&& it was clear that this is no time for complacency. librarians face threats that would damage their ability to make knowledge accessible and preserve it for cultural posterity. a new lawsuit challenges their right to digitize collections and make them available to the public. combined with an increasing lack of shelf space and spates of library closures.&& this could mean that many valuable collections end up in landfill. .&& the community is determined to make sure that libraries stay “open” to all. to this end.&& we have launched the #empoweringlibraries campaign.&& which defends the right of libraries to own and lend digital books. although the forum has ended.&& the community will stay united through campaign activities. .&& we’d like to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part and helped make the library leaders forum a great success. find out how you can stay connected and protect the key role of libraries in a democratic society here.][internet archive blogs, a blog from the team at archive.org, category archives: past event, dweb holiday fair –
