[this series is meant to teach about how science is done.&& from generating a hypothesis to designing an experiment to analyzing the results with statistics. you can repeat the steps of one of these experiments and compare your results — or use this as inspiration to design your own experiment..&& weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment.&& thank you for signing up!.&& there was a problem signing you up..&& founded in 2003.&& science news for students is a free.&& award-winning online publication dedicated to providing age-appropriate science news to learners.&& parents and educators. the publication.&& as well as science news magazine.&& are published by the society for science.&& a nonprofit 501(c)(3) membership organization dedicated to
