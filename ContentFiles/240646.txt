[by dominic casciani legal correspondent.&& bbc news.&& images of the bodies of civilians in the streets of bucha have led to international condemnation of russia and further accusations that its forces are committing war crimes..&& the international criminal court has already begun investigating whether war crimes are taking place and ukraine has also set up a team to gather evidence..&& it may not seem like it.&& but even war has rules.&& as the international committee of the red cross puts it..&& these are contained in treaties called the geneva conventions and a string of other international laws and agreements..&& civilians cannot be deliberately attacked - nor can the infrastructure that is vital to their survival..&& some weapons are banned because of the indiscriminate or appalling suffering they cause - such as anti-personnel landmines and chemical or biological weapons..&& the sick and wounded must be cared for - including injured soldiers.&& who have rights as prisoners of war..&& serious offences such as murder.&& rape or mass persecution of a group are known as crimes against humanity..&& genocide is defined in international law as the deliberate killing of people from a particular national.&& ethnic.&& racial or religious group.&& with the intention of destroying the group - whether entirely or in part..&& as such.&& genocide is a specific war crime that is bigger than the illegal killing of civilians. the law requires proof of the intent to destroy the group..&& this video can not be played.&& the 1994 slaughter in rwanda of about 800.&&000 people later led to prosecutions for genocide..&& investigators and journalists have found what appears to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in bucha.&& a town on the outskirts of kyiv.&& and other nearby areas..&& ukrainian forces say they have found mass graves and theres evidence of civilians having been shot dead after their feet and hands were bound..&& this video can not be played.&& us president joe biden has called for the russian president to be tried for war crimes.&& saying this guy is brutal.&& and that he believed mr putin to be a war criminal..&& uk prime minister boris johnson said the attacks are yet more evidence of war crimes..&& in march.&& us secretary of state antony blinken said russia had destroyed apartment buildings.&& schools.&& hospitals.&& critical infrastructure.&& civilian vehicles.&& shopping centres.&& and ambulances - actions that the us said amounted to war crimes..&& earlier that month.&& a russian strike on a theatre in mariupol appeared to be the first confirmed location of a mass killing. the word children was written in giant letters outside the building..&& ukraine previously called russias air strike on mariupols hospital a war crime..&& theres also mounting evidence that cluster bombs - munitions that separate into lots of bomblets - have hit civilian areas of kharkiv..&& the uk says russia has used thermobaric explosives.&& which create a massive vacuum by sucking up oxygen. these are not banned.&& but their deliberate use near civilians would almost certainly break the rules of war..&& many experts argue the invasion itself is a crime under the concept of aggressive warfare..&& there have been a series of one-off courts since world war two - including the tribunal investigating war crimes during the break-up of yugoslavia..&& a body was also set up to prosecute those responsible for the 1994 rwanda genocide..&& today.&& the international criminal court (icc) and the international court of justice (icj) have roles upholding the rules of war..&& the international court of justice (icj) rules on disputes between states.&& but cannot prosecute individuals. ukraine has begun a case against russia..&& if the icj ruled against russia.&& the un security council (unsc) would be responsible for enforcing that..&& but russia - one of councils five permanent members - could veto any proposal to sanction it..&& the international criminal court (icc) investigates and prosecutes individual war criminals who are not before the courts of individual states..&& its the permanent modern successor to nuremberg.&& which prosecuted key nazi leaders in 1945..&& nuremberg cemented the principle that nations could set up a special court to uphold international law..&& the iccs chief prosecutor.&& british lawyer karim khan qc.&& says there is a reasonable basis to believe war crimes have been carried out in ukraine..&& investigators will look at past and present allegations - going back as far as 2013.&& before russias annexation of crimea from ukraine..&& if theres evidence.&& the prosecutor will ask icc judges to issue arrest warrants to bring individuals to trial in the hague..&& but there are practical limitations to its power. the court doesnt have its own police force so relies on individual states to arrest suspects..&& russia is not a member of the court - it pulled out in 2016. president putin wont extradite any suspects..&& if a suspect went to another country.&& they could be arrested - but thats a very big if..&& its far easier to pin a war crime on the soldier who commits it.&& than the leader who ordered it..&& hugh williamson of human rights watch - experts in gathering evidence of war crimes in conflicts - says there is evidence of summary executions and other grave abuses by russian forces..&& he says establishing the chain of command is very important for any future trials - including either where a leader has authorised an atrocity - or turned a blind eye to it..&& theres one interesting episode in our ukraine report where a commander instructs the soldiers to take out two civilians and shoot them dead.&& he told bbc news..&& two of the soldiers object to this and that command is not carried out. so.&& theres clear evidence of some incidents in the russian army.&& but also a command and control element to it..&& the icc can also prosecute the offence of waging aggressive war. this is the crime of an unjustified invasion or conflict.&& beyond justifiable military action in self-defence..&& it originated at nuremberg.&& after the judge sent by moscow convinced the allies that nazi leaders should face justice for crimes against peace..&& however.&& professor philippe sands qc.&& an expert on international law at university college london.&& says the icc couldnt prosecute russias leaders for this because the country isnt a signatory to the court..&& in theory.&& the un security council could ask the icc to investigate this offence. but again.&& russia could veto this..&& the effectiveness of the icc - and the way international law plays out in practice - depend not just on treaties.&& but politics and diplomacy..&& prof sands and many other experts argue that like nuremberg.&& the solution lies once more in diplomacy and international agreement..&& hes calling for world leaders to set up a one-off tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression in ukraine..&& nearly 1.&&000 fighters have left mariupol steelworks -
