[fordlibrarymuseum:, it’s national coffee day!, remember sharing a pot of coffee with your coworkers? deputy chief of staff dick cheney wrote this memo to staff secretary jim connor in october 1975, wanting to know why the bill for chief of staff donald rumsfeld’s office had been over $100 the previous month. connor’s handwritten note succinctly sums up why it was so high: “they are drinking too much coffee and have too many people drinking it!”, the white house mess records showed that the bill covered 200 pots of coffee, meaning that the nine staff members and their guests had consumed about 50 pots per week in september., image:  memorandum from dick cheney to jim connor regarding the coffee bill for white house chief of staff donald rumsfeld’s office, 10/20/1975 (national archives identifier 16637889), fdrlibrary:, for the next two weeks, the fdr library will be celebrating tennis history in honor of the president’s first cousins, ellen and grace roosevelt, pictured here (ellen, left, and grace, right)., ellen won the 1890 singles title and shared the doubles championship that year with her sister grace. ellen paired with clarence hobart in 1893 to take the mixed doubles title. hobart found romance with another mixed doubles partner and won the championship with his wife augusta schultz in 1905., ellen and her sister grace were fierce competitors, belying the notion that early women’s tennis was merely a genteel past-time for elegant ladies. they actively competed in championships both at tennis clubs in the hudson valley (where they resided not far from springwood, fdr’s birthplace and home) and in tennis centers like newport and narragansett, rhode island (photo: at play in narragansett, rhode island)., photos of ellen and grace donated by their family after ellen’s death in 1954 document the early history of the game in the united states. these images include ellen and grace in formal portraits as well as in match play. some images may have been taken by ellen or grace or by their father john aspinwall roosevelt, fdr’s uncle., many have never been seen by a wide audience and may be the only photos of early us championship tennis., the men’s match shown in this photograph is one of several in our collection documenting the 1887 men’s championships between richard d. sears and henry slocum on august 30, 1887 at the newport casino in newport, rhode island. these may be the only extant photographs of the match in play. sears defeated slocum in straight sets (6-1, 6-3, 6-2). sears won the first seven us national championships, all contested on grass, in newport., fordlibrarymuseum:, remembering john paul stevens, 1920-2019, we are sad to mark the passing of supreme court justice john paul stevens earlier this week at age 99. he was the third longest serving justice at the time of his retirement in june 2010, just under 35 years after president ford appointed him to the supreme court., born in chicago, stevens graduated from the university of chicago in 1941. he served in the navy during world war ii as an intelligence officer in the pacific theater. after the war he attended northwestern university school of law and graduated first in his class. stevens then served as a law clerk to supreme court justice wiley rutledge before entering private practice. he worked for law firms in the chicago area, including one he helped form, for many years, dealing mostly with litigation and antitrust law. additionally, he taught law classes part time and gained experience serving as counsel on federal committees., stevens became a united states circuit judge for the seventh circuit court of appeals in october 1970. he served in that capacity until november 1975 when president ford nominated him to fill the supreme court vacancy created by the retirement of justice william o. douglass. “judge stevens is held in the highest esteem by his colleagues in the legal profession and the judiciary and has had an outstanding career in the practice and the teaching of law as well as on the federal bench,” president ford said in his nomination remarks. “i am confident that he will bring both professional and personal qualities of the highest order to the supreme court.”, the senate quickly confirmed stevens with a vote of 98-0 and he took his seat on the bench on december 19, 1975. although he was registered as a republican when he was appointed, over time he became viewed as part of the liberal wing of the supreme court. president ford never regretted nominating stevens. “he has served his nation well, at all times carrying out his judicial duties with dignity, intellect, and without partisan political concerns. justice stevens has made me, and our fellow citizens, proud of my three decade old decision to appoint him to the supreme court,” president ford wrote in a letter honoring justice stevens in 2005. stevens received a copy of the letter, which he reportedly displayed in his supreme court chambers., read historian richard norton smith’s interview with john paul stevens from the ford presidential foundation’s gerald r. ford oral history project., images:  president gerald
