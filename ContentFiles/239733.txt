[smart home actions rely on home graph.&& a database that stores and provides contextual data about the home and its devices. the home graph database stores information about structures (for example.&& home or office).&& rooms (for example.&& bedroom or living room).&& and devices (for example speaker and light bulb). for example.&& home graph can store the concept of a home with a living room that contains multiple types of devices from different manufacturers such as a light.&& television.&& and speaker. this information is available to google assistant in order to execute user requests based on the appropriate context. state data.&& such as if a light bulb is on.&& is not stored in the long term - it’s ephemeral and is only used in the home graph..&& home graph is essentially a logical map of your home. it allows you to have a natural conversation with google assistant. if you are sitting in the den and you want to turn the den lights off.&& you would just say hey google.&& turn off the lights and would not mention the room that you are currently in..&& benefits of home graph:.&& the google home app lets a user configure multiple structures which allows a user to manage multiple houses. each structure has its own set of rooms and devices. a structure consists of the following:.&& a room belongs to a structure and consists of the following:.&& a device must belong to at least one structure.&& can belong to a maximum of 1 room.&& and has these properties:.&& traits have these properties:.&& for more information on device types and traits.&& see device types and traits..&& figure 1 shows a sample home with a structure.&& three rooms.&& and several devices. each of these items has their corresponding properties that are described above..&& except as otherwise noted.&& the content of this page is licensed under the creative commons attribution 4.0 license.&& and code samples are licensed under the apache 2.0 license. for details.&& see the google developers site policies. java is a registered trademark of oracle and/or its affiliates..&& last updated 2022-05-09 utc.][home graph, more information, programs, developer consoles]home graph  |  actions on google smart home  |  google developers[structure][google assistant, ways to build, overview learn all the ways to build actions., extend your mobile app provide faster ways for users to access your android app via assistant., build rich and natural conversations build custom voice and visual experiences for smart devices., enhance your web presence present your content in rich ways for google search and assistant., connect your smart home devices let users control lights, doors, coffee machines, and many other devices., get inspired, why build help users find answers and get things done with google assistant., reach 1 billion devices help users at home, on the go, and in the car—on over 1 billion devices., build games build fun, voice-enabled games for smart displays., explore all actions see what others are building for google assistant., get discovered publish your actions to the assistant directory., mobile, app actions, android slices, assistant sharing, read it, content, schema.org web markup, smart home devices, overview, device types and traits, local home sdk, experimental devices, assistant sdk, conversational, overview, fundamentals, build, interactive canvas, user engagement, transactions, account linking, console, overview, localization, analytics, policies, go to console, smart home, google assistant, actions on google more, more, docs more guides reference samples and libraries codelabs support, more, guides, reference, samples and libraries, codelabs, support, community, support, learn, overview, home graph, devices and traits, smart home intents, fulfillment, account linking, touch controls, scheduling, glossary, build, create smart home actions, implement account linking oauth oauth-based app flip, oauth, oauth-based app flip, intent fulfillment, handle errors and exceptions, request sync, report state, notifications, quotas and limits, local home sdk, overview, seamless setup with bluetooth, local fulfillment, add more features, secondary user verification, app discovery and deep linking, test and deploy, test and share actions, add directory information, launch your action, monitoring and logging, troubleshooting, tools, sync data validator, test suite for smart home, google home playground, google home extension for vs code, webrtc validator tool, home graph viewer, ways to build, overview, extend your mobile app, build rich and natural conversations, enhance your web presence, connect your smart home devices, get inspired, why build, reach 1 billion devices, build games, explore all actions, get discovered, mobile, app actions, android slices, assistant sharing, read it, content, schema.org web markup, smart home devices, overview, device types and traits, local home sdk, experimental devices, assistant sdk, conversational, overview, fundamentals, build, interactive canvas, user engagement, transactions, account linking, console, overview, localization, analytics, policies, go to console, home, products, google assistant, docs, smart home, implicit commands. you, your google home device, and your lights are in the same room. all you have to say is turn on the lights. you do not need to specify what room the lights are in., better control over explicit targeting. while in a different room, you can turn off the kitchen lights even when the lights are from multiple manufacturers. the smart home intent is determined for a particular room that is identified in home graph., managers - the account of the owner(s) of the structure. each structure must have at least one manager. once a manager is defined, the manager can share and unshare a structure with other users., rooms - the rooms that are part of a structure., labels - the label that identifies the structure such as “john’s house”., devices - the devices that are part of a structure. these can be devices from multiple manufacturers., labels - the label that identifies the room such as “master bedroom”., devices - the devices that are part of the room. these can be devices from multiple manufacturers., type - the type of device such as a lamp, camera or air conditioning unit., traits - the type of traits that the device supports. each device can have a number of traits. a light might have traits such as brightness and colorsetting., attributes - the device attributes that are static for a device. an attribute can be something like temperature units, mode, etc…, state - the device state(s) for a device. a lamp might return a state of brightness to indicate the current brightness of that specific lamp. each device trait adds different device states for a device., labels - the label that identifies the device such as “bedroom lamp”., more information google assistant why build for the assistant? how google assistant works assistant directory support community, google assistant, why build for the assistant?, how google assistant works, assistant directory, support, community, programs women techmakers google developer groups google developers experts accelerators google developer student clubs, women techmakers, google developer groups, google developers experts, accelerators, google developer student clubs, developer consoles google api console google cloud platform console google play console firebase console actions on google console cast sdk developer console chrome web store dashboard, google api console, google cloud platform console, google play console, firebase console, actions on google console, cast sdk developer console, chrome web store dashboard, android, chrome, firebase, google cloud platform, all products, terms, privacy, sign up for the google developers newsletter subscribe]
