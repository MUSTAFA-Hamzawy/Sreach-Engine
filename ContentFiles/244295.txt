websites.&& to avoid confusion.&& all chapters should have one principal public source of online information about the chapter and its activities. chapters can choose to use a subdomain provided and hosted by cc hq.&& or chapters can use a domain name of their own and host/manage the site themselves. if chapters use their own domain name.&& the subdomain will be forwarded.&& so that everyone coming to creativecommons.org can find the site..&&                        subdomains: creative commons will establish a subdomain on its main website for each chapter. the sub-domain will consist of xx.creativecommons.org.&& where xx is the top-level domain extension for the project’s jurisdiction (e.g..&& ca.creativecommons.org). the subdomain will be maintained by cc hq as part of a wordpress multisite setup. each chapter is asked to designate at least one representative to be on point to correspond with cc about administrator access privileges to the subdomain..&&                        top-level domain names (“tlds”) and country code top-level domains (“cctld”): chapters may decide to use a separate domain name. we ask that such website holders hold the domain name and website in trust for creative commons.&& and add creative commons as a technical contact on the whois for the site. if.&& at any time.&& the chapter decides that the website and domain should be operated by another person or institution or retired.&& the website holder must cooperate in the transfer or lapse of the website and domain.&& as applicable. creative commons reserves the right to decide that a tld must be transferred to creative commons or shut down in order to avoid trademark confusion.&& if a chapter was unable to continue operating.&& or for any other reason..&& chapter website content.&& all website content on chapter websites should be made available under a cc license.&& ideally cc by 4.0 or cc0. chapters should establish their own guidelines for continued operation and updating of their chapter website.&& consistent with the chapter guidelines (https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-guidelines.md) and other cc policies. all chapter websites must include a prominent disclaimer that the website does not provide legal advice. cc reserves the right to request the removal of any content that fails (in cc’s sole discretion) to comply with this or other cc policies..&& chapter website administration.&& as part of the main creative commons website.&& the subdomains are managed by creative commons and therefore subject to all of the policies of the cc site.&& including the dmca policy.&& terms of service.&& and privacy policy. every participant in a chapter agrees to comply with all such policies and will take any actions requested by cc in order to ensure compliance. unlike subdomains.&& chapters that choose to operate tlds in accordance with the above are alone responsible for ensuring that they establish and maintain terms of service.&& a privacy policy.&& and any other policies necessary to comply with applicable laws.&& including copyright and data privacy laws..&& chapter social media accounts.&& chapters may establish and maintain a single account on a reasonable number of public-facing social media platforms on behalf of the chapter. the chapter should track the accounts.&& platforms.&& and login information as they are established.&& and alert cc as to which accounts it has and who operates them on behalf of the chapter. the chapter is responsible for ensuring consistency and quality in the content and operation of those accounts.&& and may establish guidelines in accordance with the chapter guidelines (https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-standards.md) to achieve this..&& chapter mailing lists.&& if a chapter wants to set up and maintain a mailing list for its activities.&& the chapter may use the services provided by creative commons. whether or not using cc-provided mailing lists.&& everyone participating in a chapter must comply with data privacy laws when dealing with participant email addresses and other personal information..&& chapter github repositories.&& each chapter may request that creative commons open one repository on their behalf on cc’s organization account on github. the chapter is responsible for ensuring that the repository is used in accordance with github terms and applicable law..&& note: this policy may be updated from time to time following consultation and collaboration with the global network council..&& .&& every cc chapter around the world.&& once established in accordance with the charter and other applicable rules and guidelines.&& may create a single logo to designate their particular country chapter (“chapter logo”). the chapter logo must include our “creative commons” name and/or our cc in a circle logo in their original font and style..&& chapter logo approval: the chapter lead must submit the chapter logo to legal@creativecommons.org for approval. for the avoidance of doubt.&& this approval requirement applies even in cases where a chapter selects a logo that was previously used in connection with a cc affiliate team under the prior network governance model..&& use of the chapter logo: we give you permission to use the approved chapter logo of the cc chapter in which you are a participant.&& solely in order to promote and further the cc-related work done by your cc
