or and then i laughed..&& and perhaps my favorite of the bunch is fido is a hot dog now which seems to be about a dog who is definitely going to hell..&& as usual.&& we are also welcoming some new books.&& movies.&& journals.&& and sheet music – this time from 1926! (read about 1925.&& 1924.&& and 1923 in previous posts.).&& some popular first edition books from 1926:.&& other interesting books from 1926 that you might want to explore include show boat by edna ferber which was made into the musical show boat in 1927 with music by jerome kern.&& the clothes we wear by frank and frances carpenter which is a child friendly exploration of how clothes are made all the way from the field through weaving and into sewing.&& or the art of kissing by clement wood which is pretty self explanatory..&& we invite you to explore some of the other items dated 1926 in our collections to find your own fun items that may now be in the public domain..&& please join us for a virtual party on january 20.&& 2022 at 1pm pacific/4pm eastern time with a keynote from senator ron wyden.&& champion of the music modernization act and a bunch of musical acts.&& dancers.&& historians.&& librarians.&& academics.&& activists and other leaders from the open world!

movies and other media from 1925 will enter the public domain in the united states. some of them are quite famous — jump ahead to see lists of those well known books and movies that you can enjoy on the internet archive — or take the scenic route with me..&& what does this all mean? essentially.&& many items created in 1925 in the us that are still under copyright will become free and open for people to use in any way they see fit in the new year. but check out duke law’s center for the study of the public domain article for a more in-depth explanation..&& we have a party every year to celebrate the new works entering the public domain.&& and this year is no exception. join us on thursday.&& dec. 17th to toast these newly available additions..&& as part of this yearly ritual.&& i explore our collections to unearth these newly freed items.&& and i invariably run across a few things that hit a nerve. this year.&& it started with this intertitle in “isn’t life terrible?” less than 20 seconds into this 1925 film.&& and suddenly i’m dumped back into 2020..&& rude.&& right? i don’t even have a front yard to enjoy during shelter in place..&& but the magic of media is that it can transport us to different places and times. photo books like picturesque italy.&& picturesque mexico.&& and picturesque palestine.&& arabia and syria show us both how much and how little has changed in the past 95 years..&& gondolas still glide under the bridge of sighs.&& and the tower of pisa is still leaning.&& but the 1925 version of the colosseum certainly lacks today’s fake gladiator photo ops..&& every toe dipped into the past has the potential to surprise or shock. the story of a pantry shelf.&& an outline history of grocery specialties is only mildly interesting on the surface. essentially.&& it’s a sales pitch to food manufacturers encouraging them to advertise in a set of women’s magazines. the book contains short case histories of successful food brands like maxwell house coffee.&& campbell soup.&& coca cola.&& etc. (all of whom advertise with them.&& naturally)..&& the book gives you a glimpse of why people were so enthusiastic about mass produced.&& packaged foods. unsanitary conditions.&& bugs in your sugar.&& milk going bad over night; things modern shoppers never think about..&& it puts this glowing praise of kraft cheese into perspective: “…a pasteurized product.&& blended to obtain a uniformity of quality and flavor.&& a thing greatly lacking in ordinary types of cheese.” (page 149).&& that’s pretty entertaining if you’re a cheese lover. i think most people would agree that kraft cheese is no longer on the cutting edge..&& but keep poking around and you find a much deeper cultural divergence. while the story of a pantry shelf is extolling the virtues of the home economics training available at cornell.&& you stumble across this horrifying sentence (page 12)..&& i was not expecting to read about orphaned babies being used as “learning aids” while flipping through stories about jell-o. intellectually.&& i know that attitudes towards children have changed over the years — the fair labor standards act.&& which set federal standards for child labor.&& wasn’t even passed until 1938. but this casual aside tossed in amongst the marketing hype still packs an emotional punch. it’s important to remember how far we have come..&& even writing that was forward-thinking for the time.&& like the booklet homo-sexual life.&& is terribly backward according to today’s standards. it’s from the little blue book series — we have many that were published in 1925.&& and the publisher was quite prolific for many years. the series provided working class people with inexpensive access to all kinds of topics including philosophy.&& sexuality.&& science.&& religion.&& law.&& and government. post wwii.&& they published criticism of j. edgar hoover and the founder was subsequently targeted by the fbi for tax evasion. but in 1925.&& they were going strong and one of their prolific writers was clarence darrow..&& darrow was writing about prohibition for the little blue book series in 1925.&& but that is also the year he defended john t. scopes for teaching evolution in his tennessee classroom. the scopes trial generated a huge amount of publicity.&& pitting religion against science.&& and even giving rise to popular songs like these two 78rpm recordings from 1925..&& like the scopes trial.&& prohibition had its passionate adherents and detractors. this was the “roaring 20s” — the year the great gatsby was published — with speakeasies and flappers and iconic cocktails. and yet the pro-prohibition silent film episodes in the life of a gin bottle follows a bottle around as it lures people into a state of dissolution..&& we even see an entire book about throwing parties that includes no alcoholic beverages at all..&& but as much as some things have changed.&& other aspects of our lives remain unchanged. people still want to tell you about their pets.&& rely on self help books.&& read stories to their kids.&& follow celebrities.&& tell each other jokes.&& and make silly videos..&& and the most unchanging part of this particular season.&& of course — children still anticipate the arrival of santa claus with questions.&& wishes and schemes..&& the silent film santa claus features two children who want to know where saint nick lives and how he spends his time. we follow him to the north pole (alaska in disguise) to see santa’s workshop.&& snow castle.&& reindeer.&& and friends and neighbors. jack frost.&& introduced around 14:20.&& appears to be wearing the prototype for ralphie’s bunny suit in “a christmas story” (but with a magic wand). stick around for the sleigh crash at 20:45.&& and right around 22:20 santa wipes out on the ice..&& and just in case you’re still doing your holiday shopping.&& i feel like i should pass on a recommendation from this ad in a 1925 the billboard magazine: armadillo baskets make beautiful christmas gifts. and you can still buy vintage versions online – trust me.&& i looked. you’re welcome..&& and now on to the blockbusters of 1925….&& .&& the emancipation proclamation went into effect on january 1st.&& 1863.&& legally freeing 3.5 million enslaved people in the confederate states. but of course.&& this executive order from president abraham lincoln came in the midst of the united states civil war.&& which didn’t end until april of 1865 – the order could not be enforced until the war was over. .&& juneteenth celebrates when enslaved people actually became free in 1865. the date.&& june 19th.&& commemorates general gordon granger of the union army announcing the executive order in galveston.&& texas.&& freeing all enslaved people in texas..&& community access tv stations around the country have shown local celebrations of juneteenth for years.&& and we thought this 2013 talk by dr. shennette garrett-scott at the allen public library in texas (via allen city tv) was particularly helpful in understanding the history of this important day..&& more resources:.&& in honor of the esteemed mathematical constant.&& we invite you to celebrate pi day with us!.&& if you’re a math geek.&& we have you covered:.&& if your mathematical knowledge could use a little refresher.&& maybe try this one instead: sir cumference and the dragon of pi : a math adventure..&& you could listen to multiple people recite the first 50 digits of pi in various styles.&& including to the tune of the battle hymn of the republic (my personal favorite).&& in the voice of bullwinkle.&& as an infomercial.&& in latin.&& while laughing.&& in morse code.&& and while eating actual pie..&& if you’re just obsessive.&& here’s.&& have insomnia? listen to the first 1.&&000 digits of pi for 9.5 minutes straight… problem solved!.&& but most importantly.&& if you want to celebrate by eating pie we can help you make one! winner of the best title award definitely goes to pies and tarts with schmecks appeal by the inimitable edna staebler. a close second goes to tarts with tops on by tamasin day-lewis. but take your pick from amongst a wide array of pie cookbooks to find the right one for you..&& and most importantly.&& we wish you infinite pi(e)..&& .&& .&& commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s.&& bringing entertainment.&& news and music into people’s homes. now.&& instead of needing to play a 78rpm disc on your phonograph.&& you could just tune in to listen to popular songs..&& and in 1923 that means you would have been listening to one of the many versions of “yes! we have no bananas” written by frank silver and irving cohn.  .&& you could listen to the billy jones version (play below).&& the billy murray version.&& a yiddish version.&& or an italian version.&& among others..&& then you could have moved on to dancing the charleston.&& popularized by the song of the same name from the 1923 musical “runnin’ wild.”   and with the explosion of recordings by african american musicians.&& you could also enjoy “baby won’t you please come home” by bessie smith and “dipper mouth blues” by louis armstrong..&& in the news of the day you saw the first flight of an autogyro (the precursor to the helicopter)..&& jack dempsey defended his world heavyweight championship title against tommy gibbons and luis firpo..&& and howard carter’s team finally entered the burial chamber of king tutankhamen.&& as covered in books.&& sheet music and song! .&& but why are we focusing on 1923? because for the first time in 20 years.&& new works are entering the public domain in the united states (read more: 1.&& 2.&& 3). and those works were all published in.&& you guessed it.&& 1923..&& settle in with a reese’s peanut butter cup.&& a butterfinger.&& or a refreshing popsicle (all invented in 1923!) while you watch cecil b. demille’s the ten commandments.&& the white sister starring lillian gish.&& or the hunchback of notre dame starring lon chaney. or any one of 50 other films available on archive.org from that year..&& after your movie marathon.&& you can turn
