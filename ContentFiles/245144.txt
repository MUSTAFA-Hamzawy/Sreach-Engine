game for junior high school.&& high school and companies and it is always a big hit – works really well..&& k. caporale ★★★★☆ i was leary to purchase word up.&& sight unseen.&& and very pleasantly surprised when my students played their first game and really enjoyed the experience. it’s a different vehicle for learning english and a nice change of pace. the game is well thought out and challenges many categories of critical thinking. the box could be made of sturdier cardboard but all other pieces and components are of good quality..&& selena long.&& english teacher.&& australia ★★★★★ i found the game…engaging for all students – reading.&& listening.&& pronunciation.&& grammar.&& vocab.&& speaking – it had the lot going for it and even one of the students mentioned the same. the other thing i noticed is that the millennial students.&& who rely heavily on digital technology.&& benefitted hugely from the friendly banter and conversation around the game that flows from board games. it became very jovial..&& allen ★★★★★ word up is an excellent classroom tool. i was thrilled to see how the game promoted conversation and animated the students. they thoroughly enjoyed it. i plan to use it regularly. the questions were challenging.&& level-appropriate.&& and diverse. love it!!.&& corinne omont ★★★★★ very appropriate in an english course and for all levels ! my students love it ! thank you for this great game !.&& alex moro ★★★★★ i tried this game with a small group of 3 people of different levels of english and it worked really well! i was substituting another teacher who couldn’t be there.&& so it proved the perfect solution for a stimulating lesson. the play is quite fast so the students don’t get bored.&& and they learn having fun. a great idea and a very good buy for me! i would certainly recommend it!.&& juanita welch-accardo ★★★★★ i love it! i agree with another user that the box could be stronger. i have to transport the game inside a sturdier box. i love the fact that the questions stimulate the students in a variety of ways that they find challenging. however.&& level 1 is not simple enough for my a1 students …who really like to learn through game playing! i recommend a complete beginner level.&& incorporating sentence building components.&& choices of articles.&& quantifiers… in very short sentence form. i would also recommend extra card packs for specific categories (the body/health.&& travel.&& business english.&& family & friends …..etc). ah.&& i would also like to see the cards printed in a larger size please. they are too difficult to read for many students with less than 20/20 vision ..which includes me!.&& vincenza catania ★★★★★ this game is fantastic. a really nice way to learn and revise vocabulary and a great opportunity to improve reading.&& listening and speaking skills. all levels can be played in one game as all players can choose their level. kids and adults playing together make this game fun and entertaining. at the end of the game.&& everyone has learnt new words and pronunciation. i strongly recommend this game and i am so happy to have found it! thanks to all the team!.&& rosa crespi ★★★★★ as a teacher of english.&& i’ve been using word up over the years and i still find it an inspiring way to get students involved in the language and have fun at the same time!! the best game ever!!.&& ajarn lucky ★★★★★ students love it. a great way for them to learn english. some of the more general knowledge questions are quite challenging but that is okay. going to laminate the question cards to make sure they last a long time..&& c becskehazy ★★★★★ this has to be one the greatest english learning tools ever! great fun and very educational! thanks .&& sunho.&& australia ★★★★★ learning english while playing games might be what everyone wants to do in their english learning journey. this game definitely helps english learners get motivated.&& encouraged.&& and challenged while having lots of fun playing!.&& andreas grammatico.&& italy ★★★★☆ i bought word up to play at home with my friends and family and i am glad i bought it. because it is a fun way to
