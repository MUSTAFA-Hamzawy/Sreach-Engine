[experts offer advice on how to eat for optimum health during and after your treatment and surgeries for ovarian cancer., for women who are undergoing treatment for ovarian cancer or who have completed treatment, nutrition is key not only to overall health and well-being, but will help you feel better throughout the day., the right selection of foods during and after treatment will meet your body’s needs for protein, vitamins, and other nutrients, and it can make a major difference in your quality of life as well. uncomfortable symptoms such as gas, bloating, and constipation are common in women with ovarian cancer, but those symptoms can be minimized with the right diet and plenty of fluids., the foods and supplements you should try to incorporate in your diet will depend on

nutrition needs while actively undergoing treatment or recovering from surgery or a complication than they would after treatment,” says taylor., keep reading to find out expert recommendations on diet and supplements for optimal health and healing during and after your ovarian cancer treatment., related: how is ovarian cancer diagnosed?, treatments for ovarian cancer, including surgery and chemotherapy, can affect your body’s needs for specific nutrients, according to amanda nickles fader, md, the vice chair of gynecologic surgical operations at johns hopkins health system in baltimore. “these treatments may also impact a woman's eating habits and how the body digests and absorbs food,” says dr. fader., there are four main goals for nutrition during ovarian cancer treatment, says fader., “the body requires more calories and certain nutrients such as protein during and after treatment in order to fight and heal. staying hydrated and eating enough calories, protein, and other nutrients during this time helps maintain muscle stores, prevent treatment delays, boost the immune system, and minimize side effects of treatment,” says taylor., sometimes it’s hard to eat enough calories and protein after treatment because you may feel full because of bloating or constipation, says taylor. “small frequent meals can help in this situation; try to include some protein with each meal, and snack whenever possible to help meet your total protein needs, she suggests., related: the stages of ovarian cancer and what they mean, you may wonder what exactly is meant by a “balanced diet,” especially if you have ovarian cancer. “in this case, a balanced diet would include all six food groups, while emphasizing minimally processed foods from each group,” says taylor. this falls in line with the american cancer society’s general recommendations to decrease risk for cancer and cancer recurrence while also supporting adequate nutrition and a healthy weight, she says., a balanced diet full of whole, nutrient-rich food is the best way to get the nutrition you need, says fader. “some supplements can be useful if you have a specific deficiency, but most studies have found that the risks of high dose supplements usually outweigh the benefits,” she says. if you are considering any supplements or vitamins, you should consult your healthcare provider first, she says., “avoid taking vitamins at more than 100 percent of the daily allowance (daily value) unless you have a nutrient or vitamin deficiency and have been directed to take more by your healthcare provider,” says fader., taylor recommends the following foods and servings for each of the six groups:, it’s also important to drink plenty of fluid, mostly in the form of water, says taylor. “i recommend at least 64 ounces (oz) a day,” she says., keep in mind that if you experience certain side effects the recommendations may be different, says taylor. “for example, if someone is having diarrhea or has an increased risk for bowel obstruction, then high fiber foods would not be typically recommended,” she says., related: 5 tricks for getting enough fruit and veggies, “women undergoing ovarian cancer treatment may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, and bloating or early satiety, which is feeling full after eating relatively small quantities of food,” says fader. “all of these digestive issues can affect a woman's nutritional status and also her desire to eat,” she says., unfortunately, these issues are relatively common during and after treatment for ovarian cancer, says taylor. there are ways to help minimize these symptoms, which can include constipation or diarrhea, gas and bloating, and increased risk for bowel obstructions, taylor says., a bowel obstruction is a blockage in the intestines that prevents foods and fluids from passing through the intestines, and it sometimes occurs in people with ovarian cancer. “if you have a history of a bowel obstruction, or your healthcare team says you are at risk for developing a bowel obstruction, there are many foods that can increase your risk for this issue,” says taylor., examples of foods to avoid if you are at
