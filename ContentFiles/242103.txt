[reviews / at home.&& i.&& like my parents and my parents’ parents.&& have spent much of my adult life relying on bleach to ensure that my home remains sparkling clean (or.&& at the very least.&& reasonably clean). the products under my kitchen sink have long included chemical-based disinfectants and cleaners.&& and for good reason—they work. but recently.&& in an attempt to adopt more eco-friendly practices and address the budding allergies that i have developed in recent years.&& i’ve gradually begun switching out my traditional cleaners with so-called “natural” or “green” cleaning products. but what exactly are these products.&& and do they work?.&& for starters.&& it can be difficult to understand what a “green” or “natural” product really is.&& especially since aren’t any guidelines around such a classification. in fact.&& as the environmental working group (ewg) notes.&& “on a cleaning product.&& the word ‘natural’ can mean anything or nothing at all—there is no regulation of the word’s use.” in general.&& a “natural” cleaning product is non-toxic.&& which means that it has no harmful effects to human health or the environment. we find that a great way to ensure that your cleaning products meet the “green” bar is to look for those that have been ewg verified..&& “to really know how ‘clean’ something is.&& you have to do your research.&&” explains melissa lush.&& the cofounder of force of nature. “in the cleaning category.&& there are some key ingredients to watch out for that are unfortunately ubiquitous. some of the most common are bleach (sodium hypochlorite).&& quats (quaternary ammonium compounds).&& ammonia.&& and fragrances.” at least one of these ingredients is commonly found in nearly every traditional cleaning product. .&& why should you care about these labels? as it turns out.&& toxic chemicals.&& including parabens.&& triclosan.&& phthalates.&& and ammonia.&& which are all common in various cleaning products.&& are not only major allergens but also contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone.&& which is damaging to natural ecosystems. studies have linked synthetic cleaning products to an increased likelihood of developing early asthma. as such.&& a growing number of manufacturers.&& including unilever.&& p&g.&& and target.&& have focused efforts on removing these chemicals from common cleaners. .&& even if you’re not actually touching (or consuming) the chemicals in traditional cleaners.&& you could still be risking your health.&& says lush. in a 2020 study researchers found that common chemicals released when using cleaning supplies were linked to chronic respiratory problems.&& allergic reactions.&& and headaches. .&& another study suggests that mothers exposed to chemicals in common cleaning products are significantly more likely to have children with asthma and wheezing during the early parts of their lives. .&& moreover.&& notes the team behind oui clean.&& a cleaning company offering green services to customers.&& “a green cleaning service is ideal for those who have experienced health issues or allergies from the severe chemicals in the cleaning products they have used previously. with natural cleaning agents.&& you’ll be much less likely to experience headaches.&& irritated or itchy eyes.&& or a sore throat.” .&& there are considerable environmental issues to keep in mind. the chemicals from your cleaners often end up in water sources.&& polluting streams and rivers. volatile organic compounds.&& otherwise known as vocs.&& are also hugely problematic to our atmosphere.&& resulting in the creation of ozone molecules and.&& consequently.&& smog..&& if you have allergies.&& lush says you should watch for certain chemicals like sls (a surfactant) and mit (a preservative).&& which could exacerbate asthma and allergies. given the ubiquity of these two ingredients.&& avoiding these toxic ingredients will narrow your options pretty quickly. .&& while you may not think much about the pleasant citrus scent of your cleaner.&& some fragrances can be detrimental to your health. “the fragrance industry isn’t required to disclose the cocktail of ingredients that go into their scents.&&” lush continues. “there is a class of chemicals used in tons of scents that make them last longer.&& called phthalates.&& which have been linked to endocrine disruption.&& birth defects.&& and developmental delays.” .&& you should take care to read the labels on your cleaning products to get a better understanding of exactly what you’re spraying on your counters and surfaces. the ewg has a great list of definitions that can help you decode the labels on your cleaning products..&& if you’re worried about end results.&& don’t.&& says oui clean. “natural cleaning products are just as effective as traditional commercial products with harsh chemicals. although you may think the harsh chemicals are necessary to get your home sufficiently clean.&& there are plenty of organic.&& eco-friendly options out there that do just as great of a job.” a 2015 study emphasizes that “environmentally preferable cleaning products” represent a safer alternative to traditional cleaning products. .&& as it turns out.&& many of the ingredients in cleaning products are not essential to actual cleaning but are used to enhance our perception of cleanliness. “for example.&& we’ve all been trained to believe that clean has a smell.&&” lush says. “but in fact.&& clean is the absence of smell! you want to kill off the source of odors like mildew or bacteria.&& not cover it up with a scent because that odor will come back.” similarly.&& products that use foaming ingredients (like surfactants) may make you think that the product is working.&& but it’s not immediately clear that they actually help with the cleaning process. .&& “all most people need is a cleaning product with a nontoxic detergent ingredient that can remove dirt.&& grease.&& grime.&& and soap scum.&& plus a nontoxic antimicrobial ingredient that can kill the bacteria.&& viruses.&& and fungi that can cause sickness and odors.&&” she says..&& as i’ve made the switch to non-toxic cleaning products.&& i’ve relied heavily on some of my favorite products.&& listed below. the ones i like best feature biodegradable inputs to minimize their carbon footprint.&& tend to be water-based.&& and are hypoallergenic. .&& a few of our favorites include: .&& bon ami has been around since 1886 and is still keeping customers happy. this scrubbing powder is as versatile as it is effective. it is composed of biodegradable.&& hypoallergenic ingredients.&& which means that both the earth and your body will appreciate this cleaner. you can use it on stainless steel.&& granite.&& porcelain.&& and ceramic (among others).&& and better still.&& the cleaner’s packaging is made of 65-percent post-consumer recycled materials. .&& this small appliance turns tap water into a multipurpose cleaner with the use of a recyclable capsule of salt.&& water.&& and vinegar. just plug the water container (which includes the aforementioned capsule) into an outlet.&& and you’ll have an epa-registered disinfectant that kills 99.9 percent of germs and is epa approved for use against covid-19. because it is literally water.&& it contains no fragrances.&& dyes.&& surfactants.&& or preservatives. you can use it just about anywhere.&& and because it’s refillable with plain old h2o.&& you can significantly reduce your dependence on plastics. .&& if you’re dealing with particularly greasy surfaces.&& this is an especially effective option. it’s water-based and non-toxic and has no fragrances to speak of. the epa approves of the product (it’s even in the organization’s safer choice database)..&& you can clean a whole range of bathroom surfaces with this safer choice–certified cleaner. whether you’re working with linoleum.&& vinyl.&& sealed marble.&& or ceramic tile.&& just spray on this product and wipe it with a reusable rag for a sparkling clean result..&& simple green’s name implies “green” cleaning and it certainly has a reputation for being a safer cleaning alternative. unfortunately.&& some of their products get an f from ewg.&& so you have to be careful with your selection. this a-rated carpet care cleaner from the naturals collection will do the trick. it’s a usda-certified bio-based product with no added colors or scents. use it to tackle stains and revive your carpets.&& rugs.&& and washable fabric furniture..&& check out the grove marketplace for a wide selection of natural and toxin-free cleaners from a wide range of brands. you’ll be able to bolster your cleaning supplies with accessories like walnut sponges.&& which are not only more effective than traditional options but also better for the planet. ][do “natural” cleaning products actually work?, what makes a product “green” anyway? , ok, but why should i use non-toxic cleaning products?,
