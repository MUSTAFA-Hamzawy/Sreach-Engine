what a biiiig list. and yes this ones really great. you understand exact meaning of those interjections while reading comic strips üôÇ, michaelon january 26, 2011 9:12 am huzzah! love your work mark. but wouldn‚Äôt a rhotic speaker write ‚Äòuh‚Äô for ‚Äòer‚Äô? might this cause some confusion for the non-rhotic speaker who could voice the former as a, sort of, near-grunt? or do you think most readers get by given the context? and yes, i agree with cecily; writers should check that their audience is familar with the interjection. most of these would pass muster in australia, but a few (e.g., ‚Äòhamana-hamana‚Äô, ‚Äòmwah‚Äô, ‚Äòneener-neener‚Äô, ‚Äòzoinks‚Äô and ‚Äòzowie‚Äô) would be met with a blank look. but then i‚Äôm sure some local expressions would seem equally strange to others. an american friend was resident in australia for six months before she realized ‚Äòta‚Äô meant ‚Äòthanks‚Äô and not ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô., emmaon january 26, 2011 9:49 am i have never heard ‚Äúhamana-hamana‚Äù and would definitely be very confused if i were to hear anyone use it. you should have included ‚Äúsheesh‚Äù, the exclamation of flustered annoyance. also, i have never heard ‚Äúfeh‚Äù, but am very familiar with ‚Äúits cousin‚Äù, ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. i don‚Äôt understand how ‚Äúnow‚Äù is an interjection, though. i always presumed it was a shortened form of sentences such as ‚Äúnow, listen to what i‚Äôm saying,‚Äù where the ‚Äúnow‚Äù suggests that the action should happen at the present time., rebeccaon january 26, 2011 11:24 am this is a fantastic list, thank you for providing it. i never knew there were so many exclamations to use. it beats using the ‚Äòsame old, same old‚Äô exclamations., rebeccaon january 26, 2011 11:25 am oops!

(eh, those are sort of before my time, but you get my drift). we update our wardrobes and our cellphones, why not update our speech? @emma: i grew up with family from europe (russia, poland), and ‚Äúfeh‚Äù was the word. i always think ‚Äúmeh‚Äù sounds like a sheep! @michael (australia): here in the us, ‚Äúta‚Äù would more likely be a shortened version of ‚Äúta-ta,‚Äù as in ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù thanks for the head-up!, cecilyon january 26, 2011 2:00 pm thebluebird11: i wasn‚Äôt saying that anyone unfamiliar with these expressions must not use them, but was warning that the definitions here are necessarily brief and don‚Äôt take account of the very specific ways that some of them are used (and not used) in different countries, age groups etc. for example, if i, as a brit, start using ‚Äúhamana-hamana‚Äù (which i had never come across till today) on the strength of this article, i will probably be met with bafflement by those around me., thebluebird11on january 26, 2011 2:12 pm @cecily: what i meant was, it‚Äôs one thing to avoid an expression because of cultural issues (as in, nobody in your country/culture would get it), another entirely to say people shouldn‚Äôt use an expression because they are too old, young, unhip, etc. still, think of this post as a chance to expand your (and your friends‚Äô) cultural horizons‚Ä¶you know the us is a big place, and expressions vary from coast to coast and border to border. i remember coming across the word ‚Äúspendy,‚Äù (meaning expensive). that‚Äôs a west-coast word, and i live 3000 miles away on the east coast, but i thought, ‚Äúwhat a great word!‚Äù and i adopted it. my friends now ‚Äúget it.‚Äù there are many books on this subject, and i find they make great mind-expanding reading. don‚Äôt shy away from using a word (or expression) you like just because your friends won‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶introduce them to it as you would introduce a new food or work of art üôÇ there‚Äôs a great big world out there!, mark nicholon january 26, 2011 3:20 pm steve: thanks for your note; you are correct. i should have said ‚Äúan extended a sound, like the doctor asks you to say when looking in your mouth.‚Äù, mark nicholon january 26, 2011 3:36 pm emma: i didn‚Äôt want to take the time in the original post to go into my criteria for inclusion and exclusion of terms in this list ‚Äî trust me, there are many more interjections ‚Äî but i tried to include only terms that have no literal meaning but have acquired one (or more) through conversational context: they are (with a tip of the hat to commenter deborah h.) basically sound effects. (though ‚Äî think about it ‚Äî trace any word back for enough, and it fits that description.) now, in retrospect, for the reason you state, does not belong. i deliberately omitted sheesh and the like because it and many other words like it are bowdlerizations of oaths invoking god or jesus, and hence have etymological antecedents. also, my language bias as an american (more specifically, a homegrown californian) should be obvious, but i admit that some of these terms are obscure; selecting on the basis of longevity and durability was a fine line to walk. my favorite interjection, which didn‚Äôt make the cut because it derives from a real word, is hella, a superlative that stands on its own and dates from the mid-1980s at the latest but as yet, to my knowledge, does not grace the pages of any printed dictionary., patrickon january 26, 2011 3:42 pm in reply to emma: ‚Äúhamana-hamana‚Äù is the written version of the vocalization jackie gleason used as ralph kramden on the long-running tv show ‚Äúthe honeymooners.‚Äù it was used whenever he was caught out by his long-suffering wife, alice and could not come up with an explanation for some boneheaded thing he‚Äôd done. i would also like to have seen ‚Äúyada-yada‚Äù from the seinfeld series. it was used to allow the listener to fill in facts universally known, similar to ‚Äúblah, blah, blah.‚Äù, amaton january 26, 2011 4:40 pm great list! thanks for the post., michaelon january 26, 2011 6:47 pm if we‚Äôre talking cartoon references, then most australians (for starters) have never heard of bill the cat. i‚Äôm fortunate to have been exposed to ‚Äòbloom county‚Äô by an american friend. it opened my eyes to some great american humour. bloody funny stuff! but ‚Äòack!‚Äô won‚Äôt mean much to most aussies. for us, the equivalent might be the long-running new zealand strip ‚Äòfootrot flats‚Äô and the dog‚Äôs immortal exclamation ‚Äòye gods!‚Äô, michaelon january 26, 2011 6:50 pm oh, and then there‚Äôs ‚Äòstruth!‚Äô little used these days (except by foreigners trying‚Äîand failing‚Äîto emulate the australian vernacular), the word is derived from the middle english exclamation ‚Äògod‚Äôs truth!‚Äô, apkon january 26, 2011 7:10 pm @emma ‚Äúi have never heard ‚Äúhamana-hamana‚Äù and would definitely be very confused if i were to hear anyone use it.‚Äù then you need an education in the comedic genius of the great one., thebluebird11on january 26, 2011 7:24 pm @michael: ‚Äúye gods‚Äù is not the equivalent of ‚Äúack.‚Äù bill the cat was nonverbal, unless you count ‚Äúack‚Äù as verbal, but it was more like a gagging sound he made, sort of randomly, maybe preparing to hack up a hairball, who knows lol. i can‚Äôt find my old bloom county comic books, but as far as i remember, the only other sound he made (except for maybe an occasional burp?) was something like ‚Äúthpbffffft.‚Äù, michaelon january 26, 2011 7:28 pm @thebluebird11: you‚Äôre quite right. i meant an equivalently well-known comic strip. should have been clearer., thebluebird11on january 26, 2011 7:30 pm @emma: i remember that sound‚Ä¶it sounded like ‚Äúhum-in-uh, hum-in-uh, hum-in-uh,‚Äù said very fast. jackie gleason used to do it on ‚Äúthe honeymooners‚Äù (tv comedy show here back in about 1965 b.i.a.s. [before internet and satellite]), when he was caught doing something and he was fumbling for an alibi, or if he was just kind of at a loss for words‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt remember everything that far back, but that is pretty much the impression i have., michaelon january 26, 2011 7:50 pm mark, ‚Äòi deliberately omitted sheesh and the like because it and many other words like it are bowdlerizations of oaths invoking god or jesus, and hence have etymological antecedents.‚Äô i‚Äôm confused; you omitted ‚Äògeez‚Äô, etc., because they might be offensive?

and thank you as well as thebluebird11., rodon january 26, 2011 10:00 pm great post it might be a good idea if you could post something about the verbs that are onomatopoeias as well, such as: snore, yawn, bark,sneeze and so on ., emmaon january 27, 2011 12:06 am mark: i never realized that ‚Äúsheesh‚Äù was derived from ‚Äújesus‚Äù, so you‚Äôre right. perhaps another post that addresses these etymologically-derived interjections would be nice, though, so we can become more familiar with those ones as well. michael: i think i see the source of your confusion. mark said that words like ‚Äúsheesh‚Äù and ‚Äújeez‚Äù ‚Äúare bowdlerizations of oaths invoking god or jesus, and hence have etymological antecedents.‚Äù he didn‚Äôt state that they were not included because they were bowdlerizations, or that any other words that were omitted were also bowdlerizations. he said that they were not included due to the fact that they were derived from other words, and these particular words happened to be a specific type of derivative: a bowdlerization. personally, i am christian and i strongly dislike the use of the names of god and christ as interjections, but i have little-to-no problem with words like ‚Äújeez‚Äù and ‚Äúsheesh‚Äù because most of the people who use them are unaware of their etymology, since the words have been in use for a long time. however, i dislike the use of ‚Äúomg‚Äù even when the speaker insists they mean ‚Äúoh my gosh‚Äù as most people know it to mean something different and would assume that that is what is intended. thebluebird11: if that‚Äôs the case, i‚Äôm much too young to know the reference. it seems that the word hasn‚Äôt persisted enough to remain familiar with my generation. some words, though, clearly do outlive their origins; if, as others are saying, the word ‚Äúack‚Äù originates from the comic strip ‚Äúbloom county‚Äù, that would be an example, as i definitely know the interjection but only know the comic strip by name and probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize it if i saw a page. it is unfortunate that people forget about things that previous generations enjoyed, but i like that a word was able to survive from it., kathrynon january 27, 2011 12:29 am ‚Äúit is unfortunate that people forget about things that previous generations enjoyed, but i like that a word was able to survive from it.‚Äù am i the only one feeling a bit condescended-to? i mean, hey man, it was like groovy in the 60s and 70s when we had our own vibes, hey, wow!. . but, we were also familiar with the lingo of the 40s and 50s, including that of the beatniks. . .and gi joe. yes? and we did not have the luxury of easy access to a smorgasbord of information about the past: recent, remote, and inbetween. agreed, it is undoubtedly nice that ‚Äúack‚Äù has come down to us from the remote fastnesses of bloom county; but geewhilikers, there is an incredible richesse of words that we have inherited from that and earlier eras. sigh. maybe i‚Äôm just getting old., kathrynon january 27, 2011 12:32 am and crotchety., deborah hon january 27, 2011 1:24 am permit me to jump back into the fray: i doubt that the word ‚Äúack‚Äù began with bill the cat, a character from the cartoon strip bloom county. but he certainly made it popular. as for the other word ‚Äúthbbft!‚Äù ‚Äîi always assumed that was what a ‚Äúraspberry‚Äù looked like spelled out. üôÇ and of course, blowing a raspberry certainly predates bloom county, too. and for those who don‚Äôt know, ‚Äúto blow a raspberry‚Äù is an act of derision, or in some cases, a signal of futility or fatigue. context is everything., kathrynon january 27, 2011 2:01 am excellent points, deborah. . .and my understanding has always been that another term for a raspberry (which was the sound made when one compressed a whoopee cushion. . .which was intended to simulate a sound of biological origin, yes?) was ‚Äúbronx cheer.‚Äù personally, i have always spelled the sound ‚Äúthbpt,‚Äù but i suspect there are many variant spellings., thebluebird11on january 27, 2011 3:30 am @michael: i am so sorry, my down-under friend‚Ä¶i had typed into my post the word ‚Äúkindly‚Äù between some brackets, meaning that i meant my little rebuke kindly, but i guess because of the brackets and html issues, the word didn‚Äôt show up. which i didn‚Äôt realize til now, because i went to work, and all these emails kept coming to my phone, but i couldn‚Äôt read them, altho in the car on the way home i read‚Ä¶ @kathryn‚Äôs posts, which cracked me up. thanks, i needed that! i love this web site, you guys (gals, mates, whatever) are the best!, michaelon january 27, 2011 3:38 am @thebluebird11: no worries. i‚Äôll let you off‚Ä¶ this time. @kathryn: crotchety but bloody funny!, melvinon january 27, 2011 9:17 am i better learn some of the others too so i can express it well. üòÄ, becky the floridianon january 27, 2011 12:13 pm i have to admit, it irks me when people confuse yay and yeah. i‚Äôm not sure why, it just does., thebluebird11on january 27, 2011 12:23 pm @becky (who might be a neighbor of mine, and glad not to be living in, say, boston right now): i think people confuse ‚Äúyea‚Äù and ‚Äúyeah,‚Äù leaving off the h. they do both mean ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but the former isn‚Äôt slang; it‚Äôs a vote for something (as opposed to against it), and also means ‚Äúindeed,‚Äù as an affirmation. the latter is slang (or at least, that‚Äôs what my mother said lol)., lauraon january 27, 2011 3:08 pm ‚Äúack‚Äù denotes disgust or dismissal? i‚Äôll be darned; i‚Äôve always used it to denote distress, a la the old ‚Äúcathy‚Äù cartoons., lauraon january 27, 2011 3:09 pm ‚Ä¶or surprise, now that i think about it a minute more., bill from la la landon january 27, 2011 3:48 pm mark, you left out an interjection i hear all the time in conversations, mostly when girls are talking; ‚Äúuknow‚Äù. what would be a good definition?, markon january 27, 2011 6:26 pm also, i have found that people with knowledge of low-level networking protocols like tcp will sometimes use ‚Äúack‚Äù in response to something that someone else says to them. my friends and i do this, typically in written communication, but it does sometimes come up in verbal communication. when spoken, we often repeat it twice over, like ‚Äúack ack.‚Äù it‚Äôs actually part of the written tcp specification; it is a shortened form of ‚Äúacknowledge.‚Äù we also use nack in the same way, as a form of negative acknowledgement, to say ‚Äúi understood what you said but my answer is ‚Äòno.‚Äù i have found that these are generally understood when talking to people that are in deep in the it crowd, but this does not mean by any standard that this usage is common. i simply offer it as an insight into a usage that some people might not otherwise encounter, as it is not likely to spread far, wide, or quickly., michaelon january 27, 2011 6:39 pm ‚Äòack-ack‚Äô always meant surface-to-air gunfire to this little boy reader of war stories., business writing, book reviews, mistakes, expressions, fiction writing, freelance writing, general, grammar, grammar 101, misused words, punctuation, spelling, style, vocabulary, writing basics, usage review, writing quizzes, home, archives, exercises, about, contact, privacy policy]
