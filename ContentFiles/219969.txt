[a security researcher in italy has discovered a flaw in internet explorer that he says could enable hackers to steal cookies from a pc and then log onto password-protected web sites., , , referring to the exploit as "cookiejacking," rosario valotta claims that a zero-day vulnerability found in every version of microsoft's ie under any version of windows allows an attacker to hijack any cookie for any web site., demonstrating his findings at security conferences this month in switzerland and amsterdam, valotta acknowledges that to exploit the hole, the hacker must employ a bit of social engineering because the victim must drag and drop an object across the pc for the cookie to be stolen., but valotta said he was able to devise the right type of challenge on a facebook page that required people to drag and drop an object by undressing an onscreen photo of a woman, noted reuters, thus allowing him to capture their facebook credentials via a cookie., "i published this game online on facebook and in less than three days, more than 80 cookies were sent to my server," he said, according to reuters. "and i've only got 150 friends.", from its point of view, microsoft doesn't see much real-world risk to cookiejacking., "given the level of required user interaction, this issue is not one we consider high risk in the way a remote code execution would possibly be to users," microsoft spokesman jerry bryant said in a statement sent to cnet., "in order to possibly be impacted a user must visit a malicious web site, be convinced to click and drag items around the page and the attacker would need to target a cookie from the web site that the user was already logged into," added microsoft. "we encourage all customers to protect themselves against potential issues by avoiding clicking on suspicious links and e-mails, as well as adjusting internet settings to higher security levels.", updated 8:50am pt with microsoft statement sent to cnet., if you have a question or comment for lance whitney, you can submit it here. however, because our editors and writers receive hundreds of requests, we cannot tell you when you may receive a response., submit your question or comment here: 0 of 1500 characters, lance whitney wears a few different technology hats--journalist, web developer, and software trainer. he's a contributing editor for microsoft technet magazine and writes for other computer publications and web sites. lance is a member of the cnet blog network, and he is not an employee of cnet., june 3, 2011 4:00 am pdt, (1985 comments), june 10, 2011 4:00 am pdt, (462 comments), june 1, 2011 8:20 pm pdt, (225 comments), june 1, 2011 4:18 pm pdt, (223 comments), june 1, 2011 7:49 am pdt, (180 comments), the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited. click here to review our terms of use., if you believe this comment is offensive or violates the cnet's site terms of use, you can report it below (this will not automatically remove the comment). once reported, our staff will be notified and the comment will be reviewed., select type of offense:, offensive: sexually explicit or offensive language, spam: advertisements or commercial links, disruptive posting: flaming or offending other users, illegal activities: promote cracked software, or other illegal content, comments (optional):, e-mail this to:, your e-mail address:, note: your e-mail address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail and in case of transmission error. neither your address nor the recipients's address will be used for any other purpose., add your own personal message: (optional), antgoo: i'm late to this party, but i can't stop watching the sarah palin/paul revere video. priceless!, cnetnews: microsoft raises concerns over sale of nortel patents http://cnet.co/myfjid, cnetnews: report: only half of genius bar visitors sync iphone http://cnet.co/j23am7, crave: report: only half of genius bar visitors sync iphone http://cnet.co/lx1aeh, cnetfalcone: just noticed that a company called chinanet online holdings has been trading on the "cnet" ticker symbol for months. http://t.co/bk8jles, cnetnews: godaddy's web site goes down http://cnet.co/j2rbca, declanm: at epic dinner in dc talking with former miss usa susie castillo, who recorded hit youtube video after she was, ah, intimately groped by tsa, cnetnews: google to discuss new search breakthroughs http://cnet.co/jlnjxe, crave: 5 fantastic google docs tips http://cnet.co/mkjc6e, cnetnews: 5 fantastic google docs tips http://cnet.co/molafl, cnet: meet the man who wants an apple retail union: http://cnet.co/khq4xh, crave: chew on this: nutrismart edible rfid tags http://cnet.co/jc26cz, cnetnews: skype to bring video chat to comcast subs http://cnet.co/iu3hh9, the hacker group says it's planning an attack on the federal reserve tomorrow over monetary policies, most likely with a ddos attack designed to shut down the agency's web site., road trip at ramstein air base in germany, aeromedical crews must care for soldiers coming in from u.s. wars abroad and prepare them for journeys home.  photos: wounded head home, online security is threatened by more than hacking and phishing attempts. check here for the latest updates on software vulnerabilities, data leaks, and rapidly spreading viruses--and learn how to protect your systems., click this link to view as xml., add this feed to your online news reader, business tech, too busy to keep up with the tech news?
