[this lotterycodex review is especially interesting to me because it reminds me that just because a certain concept is supported by the crowd, it doesn’t mean it’s correct., and sometimes, it’s also important to swim against the tide., lotterycodex did just that., according to its study, mathematics shows evidence that combinations don’t have equal probability., lotterycodex stands by its own research that a lottery strategy is practically feasible because certain mathematical principles exist to allow such a strategy., these mathematical principles in question according to lotterycodex are combinatorics and probability theory., what’s special about lotterycodex is that everything is backed up by proofs from the actual lottery results., i used to play the lottery with that wishful thinking and excitement that i could be the one against all odds. it’s that sort of thing we like, as humans, to be special., however, it doesn’t matter how much we love to feel about being special, a lottery doesn’t care about that. the bottom line is, there are no special numbers in a lottery because everything occurs randomly., you know that lottery combination that was drawn yesterday or that lucky number that is always consistently drawn? they won’t matter in the next draw. why? because it’s the lottery, it’s a game of chance., but! there’s a big but, there., the but we’re talking about is the concept of probability theory and number combinations. what lotterycodex taught me is that no matter how randomized the numbers are drawn, we can always devise a pattern in the manner by which numbers are combined that can help us get the best shot possible., of course, it’s through mathematics. that’s what lotterycodex is all about., using various combination patterns and lottery gaming tips and techniques, you can use your special numbers as a pool of number to choose from whenever you play the lottery. mind you, it’s not playing blindly but seeing through the clockworks of the lottery., see this most popular post in lotterycodex: how to win the lottery (and win sooner according to math)., lotterycodex is like a manual that will help you understand the inner workings of the lottery and it will also help you use your money wisely, play with the right mindset to avoid the danger of lottery addiction., as random as the lottery is, it doesn’t stop as being just a random game., there’s always a way around lottery which of course deals with numbers, hence math, probability, and combinatorics., it’s true that lottery is full of random numbers, but the way around it is to tinker with the number combination of those random numbers. as random as 639284 is, it can still be arranged as 2468 and 39 or 234 and 698 when these numbers are combined; these are number patterns., basically, one of the inner workings of the lottery is that the numbers are drawn at random.  however, when numbers are put together as a combination, such combination forms certain characteristics that define its probability., over a large number of draws, certain combinatorial patterns tend to dominate the lottery.  as lottery draws continue to take place, these dominant patterns must continue to dominate because the lottery must follow the dictate of the law of large numbers or lln., the lln proves that the statistics (the previous lottery draws) matches out with probability as more lottery draws continue to occur., if you are good with math, then you could probably figure out the lottery and its clockwork with just a little tinkering of the mind., but if you’re not good with numbers, then lotterycodex is just right for you.  they created a calculator to make everything a piece of cake for you., lotterycodex already hands to you on a silver platter the patterns by which you can combine your favorite numbers for you to have a little edge and a little more fun in playing the lottery., there are more patterns than what is mentioned and lotterycodex links to various resources you can use to be surer of your combination., another inner working is the concept of negative and positive expected value., at first, i thought that when we talk about the prize, whether it’s in millions of dollars or billions, there’s always a profit. but i never see through the cost of the lottery ticket i’m losing because i always head for the prize., lotterycodex got me to stop, look, and listen to realign my goals., if we only aim for the prize and not for the fun and thrill, then we lose the ‘play’ in the lottery and we might as well invest our money in the stock market or insurance., the website teaches us that combinations don’t have equal probability., through the use of combinatorics and probability theory, lotterycodex can separate the best types of combinations from the worst ones.  so lotto players get the best shot possible instead of wasting money on useless combinations that won’t likely occur in one million draws., , image by lotterycodex, furthermore, lotterycodex advises you to save money for playing just like how you save money for a movie that you really want to watch. if we save, we can be more conscious of the money we’re losing and we can gauge if the money lost is worth the fun lottery brings., this kind of saving money to play keeps us from being dependent on the lottery as an investment alternative, and it keeps us from being addicted to the lottery., the right mindset as lotterycodex likes to put it, is that the lottery is just a game and it’s never a potential business nor an investment., a mathematical strategy can be there to help you play effectively but in the end, lotterycodex emphasizes the fact that the lottery is all about the fun in playing and the consolation that the money you lost goes to charity., lotterycodex lets you think about it this way: it’s like helping out with charity. will you donate to charity your hard-earned money that is allotted for your basic needs (i.e. food)?, the lottery is just a fun way to donate to charity, you shouldn’t treat it like it’s a business or else you may be on the road to lottery addiction., what i like about lotterycodex is the advocacy they try to instill in the mind of every lotto player.  the website does not only teach lottery strategy but also emphasize the importance of a proper mindset more than anything else., as far as strategy is a concern, lotterycodex doesn’t teach anything based on assumptions and opinions.  it backs up everything it says using the logic of mathematics and proves everything using the actual lottery draws.][lifetickler, lotterycodex review: a mathematical strategy through the eyes of a clueless lotto gamer, lotterycodex versus random lottery, lotterycodex and the inner workings of the lottery,
