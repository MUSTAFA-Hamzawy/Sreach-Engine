heres a rundown of updates weve been able to make to the site this month.&& including some big tweaks to the profile page!.&&  .&& by the people runs on concordia.&& the open source transcription platform developed by the library of congress. this release is concordia version 0.6.18. concordia is free to use and reuse -- learn more and see our code on github. thanks to our developer team for all their hard work!.&&  .&& we heard from volunteers who did not expect instructions to be located under help.&& so weve changed the label. you can still find our transcription.&& review.&& and tagging instructions there. and thanks to a drop-down menu.&& its easier to get directly to the instructions you need from wherever you are on the site!.&& .&& the profile page is available to all registered and logged in users. see yours here! weve added some new contribution data and new ways to navigate.&& as well as service letter generator..&& the first thing youll notice is that my contributions now shows transcription activity (saves & submits) and review activity (reviews).&& as well as a total for all activity on the site. we did this to help volunteers better understand their contributions and be able to count them accordingly.&& whether for personal interest or for community service requirements..&& we also hope it will now be much easier to navigate back to a page you worked on! the my contributions table records your actions on the site (save.&& submit.&& accept.&& reject) and the pages worked on list below tracks the pages where you took those actions. we wanted to make that clearer.&& so we added a header.&& and moved the action information to the right. by default the page list will now sort by date.&& with the most recent first..&& you can also now filter your pages by campaign! if you click on a campaign title (for example.&& clara barton: angel of the battlefield) in the my contributions table.&& the list below will filter to display only those pages you worked on in that particular campaign. select all campaigns in the last row of the my contributions table to reset the list..&& .&& the final major change youll see is the service letter generator. during the pandemic.&& weve received an outpouring of requests to provide service letters for students and others who are volunteering for school or community service credit. now volunteers can generate needed documentation from the profile page! please contact us if you need any modifications to the self-serve letter –were happy to provide them..&& a reordered homepage.&& in response to volunteers need for more direct access to onboarding materials.&& we moved the links to help guides for transcribing and review to the top of the page. weve seen an incredible increase in volunteers this year and this simple update will help new and returning contributors find the resources they need to get started!.&& if you scroll a little further down the homepage.&& youll see a brand new way to jump into the collections. use the surprise me bar to jump to a random page that needs transcription or a random page that needs review. click on these links to find something new to work on!.&& .&& easier to understand campaign progress.&& weve also made a slight update to the display of status labels. completed projects now feature a complete flag to indicate that all of the pages in that project have been transcribed and reviewed. and we increased the contrast on the color scheme used to indicate the collection progress (needs review.&& in progress.&& not started) to make it easier to tell what has been done and what still needs doing!.&& you may also notice a very slight change to the contributors count above the campaign progress bar.&& which now reads registered contributors. we wanted to make it clear that the contributor count does not include anonymous transcribers. our community of volunteers is even larger than that number indicates!.&& .&& let us know what you think of the changes! what other updates or features would you like to see? we value your feedback in making by the people work better for all volunteers and the library..&& there are some really hidden treasures in all these letters and indecipherable cursive. i hit one today that was just so cool to discover i have to share.  i used to write newspaper columns about this sort of thing..&&  .&& so im working on page 666 and 667 of the roosevelt papers.&& series 1.&& letters and related materials.&& puzzling over what the heck is that word and this word and what is teddy being invited to and it occurs to me that we have a date on the letter.&& may 1.&& 1901.&& when (indecipherable squiggle) is required by law to start and it is clear from the letter that teddy is being invited to be at that.&& whatever it is..&&  .&& the person who did the first try at transcribing this guessed it was signed by someone named mark williams..&&  .&& nice guess.  i agreed at first. cursive writing will fool you.  but i got curious: what was this letter about?.&&  .&& ok.&& in 1901 teddy was an important guy and his whereabouts were often in the press.  he would only be invited to important things. what was happening on may 1 in 1901 that he would be at?.&&  .&& well.&& in 1901 he was vice president of the us..&&  .&& nytimesmachine finds that.&& on may 2.&& 1901.&& there was a story about the opening of the pan-american exposition in buffalo the previous day..&&  .&& buffalo?  that letter was written by a guy in buffalo..&&  .&& google the address 1168 delaware ave..&& buffalo ny..&&  .&& wow--historic stuff!  in 1901 it is the residence of john g. milburn.&& president of the board of directors of the pan-american exposition of 01. (indecipherable squiggle) starts with what looks like a cursive capital e.&& or at least john milburns version of one..&&  .&& so the president of the exposition is asking the vice president of the us to come help kick off the festivities. and.&& yes.&& if you ponder the signature on the letter that is a capital g. in the middle.&& which makes the rest of the signature make sense as john g. milburn..&&  .&& it gets better..&&  .&& roosevelt isnt mentioned in the news account in the ny times.  he wasnt particularly excited about being vice president.&& it seems.&& so even though milburn said his attendance was critical and would be the key to the festivals success.&& he apparently didnt go.&& or if he did the times ignored him?  hard to believe..&&  .&& who did go? president mckinley.&& in september.  he stayed with the milburns and on sept. 6 he was shot at the exposition and taken --  yup -- to the milburn house. the milburns moved elsewhere and mckinley lingered there in their house until the 14th when he died. his funeral was held there on the 16..&&  .&& at which point the milburns got their house back and teddy became president..&&  .&& the house went through the usual devolution of stately homes of the victorian period.&& passing through various owners and being turned into apartments and finally demolition in 1957..&&  .&& theres a marker at the curb.&& but ive been tingling for the last hour at all the connections in this one simple letter..&& charlie trentelman.&& ogden.&& utah.&&  .&&  .&& this blog is by library of congress manuscript historian.&& dr julie miller.&& june 4.&& 2020.&&  .&& the george washington papers at the library of congress mostly document the life of george washington. there’s nothing surprising about that. what is surprising is that washington’s papers also contain a lot of fragmentary.&& often eloquent information about the lives of much more ordinary people. these are people we would know nothing about except that their lives happened to intersect with washington’s. they include servants.&& slaves.&& grocers.&& dentists.&& wine merchants.&& bakers.&& tavernkeepers.&& landladies.&& seamstresses.&& and laundresses. many of them were women..&&  .&& one of the best places to find out about these people in washington’s papers is in the meticulous records he kept of his public and private spending. these invoices.&& receipts.&& and ledger books constitute the thirty-four volumes of series 5. the receipted bills washington kept of his spending during the revolutionary war.&& in series 5.&& volume 29.&& are the focus of our latest crowdsourcing project.&& “ordinary lives in george washington’s papers: the revolutionary war.”.&&  .&& i would like to introduce you to one group of women you will meet as you work your way through these receipts. they are the laundresses who worked for washington during the revolutionary war..&&  .&& washington’s steward caleb gibbs made an understandable mistake when he wrote that margaret thomas received “twenty eight pounds seventeen shillings & sixpence pennsylvania currency in full for washington done for his excellency general washington” for almost eighteen months of washing. washington was on the move during this period.&& so thomas probably traveled with his household. she signed the receipt herself..&&  .&& martha morris probably lived in new york.&& since the single bill she submitted to washington.&& in october.&& 1776.&& is dated from there. it describes her and her work this way: “cloas washd by marther the negor wench.” the back of the receipt.&& similarly: “negro wench’s bill for washing linnen.” when the british occupied new york after washington fled.&& just after the date of this bill.&& they offered freedom to escaped slaves. if morris was among them.&& she might have chosen to stay in the city. read more about her here..&&  .&& between july and september.&& 1776 andrew marschalk submitted five bills for washing and mending performed by “mrs. marschalk.” because marschalk’s bills end when washington left new york.&& it’s likely the family lived in the city. mrs. marschalk’s labor supported the family.&& but anglo-american law entitled her husband to her earnings.&& as these receipts demonstrate..&&  .&& in may.&& 1776 sarah einglis submitted a bill for washing martha washington’s aprons.&& handkerchiefs.&& and ruffles. george washington’s letters show that he was in new york on that date. this receipt is a piece of evidence to show that his wife was there.&& too. einglis appears to have written out this receipt herself..&&  .&& the bills submitted by this diverse group of women are a window into their working and economic lives.&& and add a rich layer to our understanding of the revolutionary war as it was experienced by ordinary people. we hope you enjoy puzzling out these receipts.&& and helping researchers and students of the future to more easily search and access these small.&& but important documents..&& this blog is by library of congress manuscript historian.&& dr julie miller.&&  .&& today were releasing a new by the people campaign featuring handwritten receipts and interrogations of deserters--documents found in the george washington papers at the library of congress. read this blog and then visit “ordinary lives in george washington’s papers: the revolutionary war” to transcribe.&& review.&& or read these historic materials..&&  .&& in 1782.&& during the revolutionary war.&& the american artist john singleton copley painted this portrait of thirteen-year-old augustus brine.&& a sailor in the british royal navy. the boy’s capable hands and confident stance.&& startlingly combined with his rosy cheeks and curly hair.&& are a clue that the redcoats we learned about when we were children may not have been exactly as we imagined..&&  .&& .&& more evidence to prove the truth of this is in two small notebooks in series 6a of the george washington papers at the library of congress. these contain notes made by washington’s aides as they interrogated british deserters and escapees. the interrogations took place around new york city in 1782 and 1783 while the city was occupied by british troops..&&  .&& these men constituted a diverse group. they were americans pressed into british service.&& sailors captured from french ships.&& escapees from british prison ships.&& hessian mercenaries.&& and americans serving in loyalist regiments.&& including the one commanded by benedict arnold after his defection. responding to a set of questions.&& they give their names and histories.&& describe conditions at british encampments.&& and tell where.&& how.&& and why they left..&&  .&& christian reidenby.&& a hessian mercenary.&& deserted his regiment on governor’s island because he owned land in georgia and preferred to stay in the united states. john carrol.&& a sailor originally from philadelphia.&& had been impressed by the british and imprisoned in jamaica. then he sailed on a privateer.&& and finally escaped from a british ship on lake champlain. richard green and daniel lane deserted from the loyalist corps headed by benedict arnold. they had enlisted with arnold in order to get out of jail in british-occupied new york. james nealy.&& a fifer.&& escaped his regiment on long island. he reported that “great uneasiness prevails” in his corps.&& probably because they had learned of the impending evacuation of new york and the shipment of british troops to the west indies.&& where they knew that heat and disease threatened the lives of british soldiers..&&  .&& george washington used the information he learned from these and other deserters in his plans. today these capsule biographies.&& which range from one sentence to several paragraphs each.&& should interest anyone who wants to gain a complex understanding of the british or british-allied men and boys who occupied new york during the revolutionary war..&& hi all.&&.&&  .&& to round out poetry month (april) were proposing a walt whitman challenge! read more about it on the library of congress poetry and literature blog..&&  .&& as part of this challenge were joining with colleagues from the learning and innovation office at the library and the national council of teachers of english. join us friday.&& may 1 for a review-a-thon webinar geared towards educators to learn more about using by the people in their classrooms (virtual or in-person!) and whitman primary sources such as his drafts and the printed journals where his works often appeared before he gathered them together in leaves of grass..&&  .&& we wont be making daily updates on progress here as we normally do for challenges.&& but as of 11am on april 30.&& 2020 1.&&246 pages in the poetry project still need to be reviewed. once these are all reviewed we can bring all of the almost 4.&&000 whitman pages back to the librarys main website where theyll enhance search and accessibility..&&  .&& thanks for your help!.&& victoria and the by the people team.&& today we launched herencia: centuries of spanish legal documents.&& featuring pages written in spanish.&& latin.&& and catalan between 1300 and 1800. our aim is to transcribe the documents word-for-word so that researchers can more easily discover these materials. this law library collection is our first entirely non-english campaign! it includes papers pertaining to laws.&& statutes.&& instructions.&& and decrees of spanish kings.&& government officials.&& and the catholic church.&& including the spanish inquisition and papal bulls. aside from english language titles and short descriptions created by the library.&& we know little about the texts or the topics.&& individuals.&& and significant historical moments documented within the collection. most names.&& places.&& geographical regions.&& and other details that would be of interest to scholars are still waiting to be discovered. legal documents shed light on what societies and individuals value.&& and the struggles.&& hopes.&& and triumphs of people across the societal spectrum..&& delve into european history and practice your skills reading and transcribing spanish.&& latin and catalan as you help the law library of congress uncover the mysteries of this collection. remember.&& you can contribute at your own pace and at times that are convenient for you. while foreign language skills are helpful.&& you do not need to read or speak spanish.&& latin.&&

their hard truth. they were written by rosa parks sometime after her arrest in 1955 for defying a montgomery.&& alabama.&& bus driver’s order to give up her seat to a white passenger. they can be found among her autobiographical writings in the rosa parks papers. today.&& february 4th.&& parks birthday.&& were launching these and other materials from her collection https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/?loclr=eacwdas rosa parks: in her own words. the pages include letters to and from friends and family.&& records about her activism and lifelong fight for equal rights.&& programs from events that featured or honored her.&& and a small number of miscellaneous items.&& including her featherlite pancake recipe with a secret ingredient..&& we hope transcribing rosa parks’s writings.&& notes.&& and statements will bring you insight into her upbringing and family.&& her arrest and the montgomery bus boycott.&& and the pernicious impact of racism and jim crow segregation. parks was a powerful writer whose strong words and keen insights hit home. many of these writings and notes are in draft form. she wrote on scraps of paper.&& often using the backs of incoming letters.&& event and sermon programs.&& and envelopes. the purpose of these writings isn’t always clear. many were notes for speeches. some may have be been intended for memoirs long before she wrote rosa parks: my story (1992). parks may have used writing as a way to process her arrest.&& the boycott.&& and their aftermath. most of her writings are undated.&& although dates can be inferred from the dated letters and programs on which she wrote and from stationery letterhead. many are featured in the librarys current exhibition (also titled rosa parks: in her own words).&& which inspired this campaign..&& your transcriptions may lead to new discoveries about when and why some of these notes and drafts were written. one of the great archival myths is that archivists have time to read every word.&& untie every knot.&& and solve every mystery in a collection. they don’t.&& and unresolved mysteries abound. these documents have only been available for a large public audience for a few years.&& and to date they have not been transcribed and made word-searchable online.&& which is what youre doing when you take part in any by the people campaign. what will you discover?.&& explore the rosa parks campaign.&& update 2/3/20:.&& congratulations on completing another successful challenge! together we moved the number of completed pages in
