[skip to content, if you or someone you love is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, it’s natural to be concerned about survival rate, outlook (prognosis), treatment, and whether a cure is possible. , understanding how ovarian cancer is staged and what each stage means can give you an idea of what to expect. your stage can also help you find ovarian cancer clinical trials to participate in., in order to plan treatment and predict prognosis, a doctor determines a person’s cancer stage using the results of diagnostic tests, imaging scans, and samples taken from surgery., for ovarian cancer, your doctor will likely use the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) or international federation of gynecology and obstetrics (figo) staging system., below are the four stages of ovarian cancer. each of these stages, except stage 4, is divided into a, b, and c., note: the medical standard is to refer to stages using roman numerals, i.e., stage i, stage ii, stage iii and stage iv., when a person has stage 1 ovarian cancer, it means the cancer has been found in one or both ovaries. 15% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with stage 1., most women with stage 1 ovarian cancer have an excellent prognosis. stage 1 patients with grade 1 tumors have a 5-year survival of over 90%, as do patients in stages 1a and 1b. survival rates are often based on studies of large numbers of people, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. other factors impact a woman’s prognosis, including her general health, the grade of the cancer, and how well the cancer responds to treatment., for all types of ovarian cancer taken together, about 3 in 4 (72.4%) women with ovarian cancer live for at least 1 year after diagnosis. almost half (46.2%) of women with ovarian cancer are still alive at least 5 years after diagnosis. women diagnosed when they are younger than 65 do better than older women., generally women with stage 1 ovarian cancer have a total abdominal hysterectomy, removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes (called a salpingo-oophorectomy), an omentectomy (removal of the omentum, a sheet of fat that covers some abdominal organs), biopsy of lymph nodes and other tissues in the pelvis and abdomen. women of childbearing age who wish to preserve their fertility and whose disease is confined to one ovary may be treated by a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without a hysterectomy. (omentectomy and the other parts of the staging procedure are still performed.) depending on the pathologist’s interpretation of the tissue removed, there may be no further treatment if the cancer is low grade, or if the tumor is high grade the patient may receive combination chemotherapy. learn more about the different treatments and therapies., stage 2 ovarian cancer means the cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis. stage 2 is a small group, compromising 19% of ovarian cancer diagnoses., most women diagnosed with stage 2 ovarian cancer have a five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. survival rates are often based on studies of large numbers of people, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. other factors impact a woman’s prognosis, including her general health, the grade of the cancer, and how well the cancer responds to treatment., for all types of ovarian cancer taken together, about 3 in 4 women with ovarian cancer live for at least 1 year after diagnosis. almost half (46.2%) of women with ovarian cancer are still alive at least 5 years after diagnosis. women diagnosed when they are younger than 65 do better than older women., treatment for stage 2 ovarian cancer includes: hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes), debulking of as much of the tumor as possible, and sampling of lymph nodes and other tissues in the pelvis and abdomen that are suspected of harboring cancer. after the surgical procedure, treatment may be one of the following: 1) combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy or 2) combination chemotherapy. learn more about the different treatments and therapies., stage 3 ovarian cancer means that the cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or nearby lymph nodes. it is also considered stage 3 ovarian cancer when it has spread to the surface of the liver. 60% of all cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed when they are stage 3., are you or a loved one diagnosed with ovarian cancer? subscribe for support and resources., most women diagnosed with stage iii ovarian cancer have a five-year survival rate of approximately 39%. survival rates are often based on studies of large numbers of people, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. other factors impact a woman’s prognosis, including her general health, the grade of the cancer, and how well the cancer responds to treatment., for all types of ovarian cancer taken together, about 3 in 4 women with ovarian cancer live for at least 1 year after diagnosis. almost half (46%) of women with ovarian cancer are still alive at least 5 years after diagnosis. women diagnosed when they are younger than 65 do better than older women., treatment for stage iii ovarian cancer is the same as for stage ii ovarian cancer: hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes), debulking of as much of the tumor as possible, and sampling of lymph nodes and other tissues in the pelvis and abdomen that are suspected of harboring cancer. after surgery, the patient may either receive combination chemotherapy possibly followed by additional surgery to find and remove any remaining cancer. learn more about the different treatments and therapies., when a person is diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer, the cancer has spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or tissue inside the liver. cancer cells in the fluid around the lungs is also considered stage 4 ovarian cancer., are you or a loved one diagnosed with ovarian cancer? subscribe for support and resources., most women diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer have a five-year survival rate of approximately 17%. survival rates are often based on studies of large numbers of people, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. other factors impact a woman’s prognosis, including her general health, the grade of the cancer, and how well the cancer responds to treatment., for all types of ovarian cancer taken together, about 3 in 4 women with ovarian cancer live for at least 1 year after diagnosis. almost half (46%) of women with ovarian cancer are still alive at least 5 years after diagnosis. women diagnosed when they are younger than 65 do better than older women., treatment for stage 4 ovarian cancer will consist of surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by combination chemotherapy. learn more about the different treatments and therapies., by looking at the cells in the tissue and fluid under a microscope, a pathologist describes the cancer as grade 1, 2, or 3. grade 1 is most like ovarian tissue and less likely to spread; grade 3 cells are more irregular and more likely to metastasize. however, many ovarian cancers are categorized simply as “low grade” or “high grade.” chemotherapy is often not used to treat low grade stage i cases., sources:, cancer stat facts: ovarian cancer. surveillance, epidemiology, and
