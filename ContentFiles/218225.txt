[web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from march 2011. this uses the new hq software for distributed crawling by kenji nagahashi., what’s in the data set: crawl start date: 09 march, 2011 crawl end date: 23 december, 2011 number of captures: 2,713,676,341 number of unique urls: 2,273,840,159 number of hosts: 29,032,069, the seed list for this crawl was a list of alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date. we used heritrix (3.1.1-snapshot) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. the scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites., however this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. for example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). we also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed., we have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with. we have also done some further analysis of the content., if you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it. we may not be able to say “yes” to all requests, since we’re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered., advanced search, , , it looks like online privacy is getting hit from the left., senate commerce committee chairman john rockefeller (d-w.va) plans on introducing a bill next week that will require companies to give consumers the opportunity to opt out of online tracking, and will give the federal trade commission the power to pursue enforcement actions against those that don't., "consumers have a right to know when and how their personal and sensitive information is being used online -- and most importantly to be able to say 'no thanks' when companies seek to gather that information without their approval," mr. rockefeller said in a statement. "this bill will offer a simple, straightforward way for people to stop companies from tracking their every move on the internet.", the senator's bill, called the do-not-track online act of 2011, would allow for companies to, at the minimum, collect information necessary to function -- though it is unclear how that standard would be defined -- and it would empower the federal trade commission to prosecute offenders. for consumers who ask not to be tracked, the bill would require companies "to destroy or anonymize the information once it is no longer needed," according to senator rockefeller's office., while the proposed bill hasn't been released, according to insiders, it takes as its template some of the new do-not-track features now being incorporated into web browsers from mozilla and microsoft., a more-comprehensive privacy bill was introduced by sens. john mccain and john kerry and aims to protect consumers' data online. that bill, which is expected to gain wide bipartisan support, does not specify a do-not-track requirement, though it leaves open the possibility for mechanisms that may function in that way. the kerry-mccain bill, known as the commercial privacy bill of rights act, is seen as a legislative move to centralize various privacy efforts already under way from industry trade groups, government regulators and the obama administration., the introduction of senator rockefeller's bill is a typical legislative maneuver designed to politick some new measures into the kerry-mccain bill, which already looks to "ensure that businesses collecting personal information will secure that information and will allow those people to say whether or not they want that information used.", marketing news, intelligence & conversation: wherever you go., live streams, news reports and video from our conference showcasing the best and most interesting digital innovation, it isn't a top 10 list or a merit badge, but it is about the people changing the way we think about digital media and marketing., still not quite sure what a check-in is?
