[data structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. this tutorial will give you a great understanding on data structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level applications and need of algorithms, and data structures., as applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days., data search − consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. if the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. as data grows, search will become slower., processor speed − processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records., multiple requests − as thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data., to solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly., algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language., from the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms −, search − algorithm to search an item in a data structure., sort − algorithm to sort items in a certain order., insert − algorithm to insert item in a data structure., update − algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure., delete − algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure., the following computer problems can be solved using data structures −, this tutorial is designed for computer science graduates as well as software professionals who are willing to learn data structures and algorithm programming in simple and easy steps., after completing this tutorial you will be at intermediate level of expertise from where you can take yourself to higher level of expertise., before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of c programming language, text editor, and execution of programs, etc., 42 lectures 1.5 hours, ravi kiran, 141 lectures 13 hours, arnab chakraborty, 26 lectures 8.5 hours, parth panjabi, 65 lectures 6 hours, arnab chakraborty, 75 lectures 13 hours, eduonix learning solutions, 64 lectures 10.5 hours, eduonix learning solutions, , we make use of cookies to improve our user experience. by using this website, you agree with our cookies policy. agree learn more][data structure and algorithms tutorial, why to learn data structure and algorithms?, applications of data structure and algorithms, audience, prerequisites, useful video courses]data structure and algorithms tutorial[][academic tutorials big data & analytics computer programming computer science databases devops digital marketing engineering tutorials exams syllabus famous monuments gate exams tutorials latest technologies machine learning mainframe development management tutorials mathematics tutorials microsoft technologies misc tutorials mobile development java technologies python technologies sap tutorials programming scripts selected reading software quality soft skills telecom tutorials upsc ias exams web development sports tutorials xml technologies multi-language interview questions, academic tutorials, big data & analytics, computer programming, computer science, databases, devops, digital marketing, engineering tutorials, exams syllabus, famous monuments, gate exams tutorials, latest technologies, machine learning, mainframe development, management tutorials, mathematics tutorials, microsoft technologies, misc tutorials, mobile development, java technologies, python technologies, sap tutorials, programming scripts, selected reading, software quality, soft skills, telecom tutorials, upsc ias exams, web development, sports tutorials, xml technologies, multi-language, interview questions, data structures & algorithms, dsa -
