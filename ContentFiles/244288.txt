the women in them were definitely not simple and delicate..&& the one exception appears in an early work by allender from 1914. the cartoon shows a weary woman holding a toddler while another little girl plays with a cat in the street of a working-class neighborhood. it is titled “the inspiration of the suffrage worker.” for those women still stuck in the drudgery of caring for a home and children.&& it seems to say.&& we will fight for you.&& too. the young mother in the cartoon is anything but delicate. she looks just as determined as the suffragists. perhaps the girl petting the cat will grow up to be just as fierce..&& suffrage cat is part of the national park service’s celebration of the 19th amendment. 2020 marks the centennial of the amendment!.&& sources:.&& o’gran.&& patri. “traveling for suffrage part 1: two women.&& a cat.&& a car.&& and a mission.” the national museum of american history.&& smithsonian institution.
