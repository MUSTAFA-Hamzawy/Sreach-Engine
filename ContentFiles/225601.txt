debrodt, chujun song, wei zheng international conference on data engineering (icde 2022) 2022 amazon athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows efficiently analyzing large volumes of data stored in amazon s3 using ansi sql. some design choices in the engine, especially those concerning streaming of intermediate results, can result in suboptimal executions for query patterns that have common expressions. in this paper we build upon recent work and introduce new optimizations in cloud and systems, the critical role of process analysis in chemical recycling and upcycling of waste plastics scott r. nicholson, julie e. rorrer, avantika singh, mikhail o. konev, nicholas a. rorrer, alberta c. carpenter, alan jacobsen, yuriy román-leshkov, gregg t. beckham 2022 there is an urgent need for new technologies to enable circularity for synthetic polymers, spurred by the accumulation of waste plastics in landfills and the environment and the contributions of plastics manufacturing to climate change. chemical recycling is a promising means to convert waste plastics into molecular intermediates that can be remanufactured into new products. given the growing interest in sustainability, think before you speak: explicitly generating implicit commonsense knowledge for response generation pei zhou, karthik gopalakrishnan, behnam hedayatnia, seokhwan kim, jay pujara, xiang ren, yang liu, dilek hakkani-tür acl 2022 2022 implicit knowledge, such as common sense, is key to fluid human conversations. current neural response generation (rg) models are trained to generate responses directly, omitting unstated implicit knowledge. in this paper, we present think-before-speaking (tbs), a generative approach to first externalize implicit commonsense knowledge (think) and use this knowledge to generate responses (speak). we expect conversational ai / natural-language processing, automated reasoning (12), cloud and systems (69), computer vision (197),

2022 2022 large-scale conversational assistants such as cortana, alexa, google assistant and siri process requests through a series of modules for wake word detection, speech recognition, language understanding and response generation. an error in one of these modules can cascade through the system. given the large traffic volumes in these assistants, it is infeasible to manually analyze the data, identify requests conversational ai / natural-language processing, product answer generation from heterogeneous sources: a new benchmark and best practices xiaoyu shen, gianni barlacchi, marco del tredici, weiwei cheng, adria de gispert, bill byrne acl 2022 ecnlp workshop 2022 it is of great value to answer product questions based on heterogeneous information sources available on web product pages, e.g., semistructured attributes, text descriptions, user-provided contents, etc. however, these sources have different structures and writing styles, which poses challenges for (1) evidence ranking, (2) source selection, and (3) answer generation. in this paper, we build a benchmark conversational ai / natural-language processing, faster post-quantum tls handshakes without intermediate ca certificates panos kampanakis, michael kallitsis the 6th international symposium on cyber security, cryptology and machine learning (cscml 2022) 2022 traditionally, the most data-heavy part of a (d)tls handshake has been authentication which includes a handshake signature and digital certificates. although most common (d)tls usecases are not significantly affected, some constrained ones such as low bandwidth environments or delay sensitive applications can see drastic performance degradation due to big certificates or certificate chains. that has led security, privacy, and abuse prevention, answer consolidation: formulation and benchmarking wenxuan zhou, qiang ning, heba elfardy, kevin small, muhao chen naacl 2022 2022 current question answering (qa) systems primarily consider the single-answer scenario, where each question is assumed to be paired with one correct answer. however, in many real-world qa applications, multiple answer scenarios arise where consolidating answers into a comprehensive and non-redundant set of answers is a more efficient user interface. in this paper, we formulate the problem of answer consolidation conversational ai / natural-language processing, on-the-fly discovery of local bugs using inconsistency analysis srinivasan h. sengamedu, qiang zhou, hangqi zhao iclr 2022 dl4c workshop 2022 traditional bug detection mechanisms have focused on a limited set of important issues and have specialized detectors for each of them. as the code corpora continue to grow in size and complexity, newer opportunities for a developer to make mistakes emerge, leading to long tail of local bugs. hence, we must investigate generalizable approaches that can detect such bugs. in this paper, we formulate and use machine learning, paragraph-based transformer pre-training for multi-sentence inference luca di liello, siddhant garg, luca soldaini, alessandro moschitti naacl 2022 2022 inference tasks such as answer sentence selection (as2) or fact verification are typically solved by fine-tuning transformer-based models as individual sentence-pair classifiers. recent studies show that these tasks benefit from modeling dependencies across multiple candidate sentences jointly. in this paper, we first show that popular pre-trained transformers perform poorly when used for fine-tuning on conversational ai / natural-language processing, on the limits of evaluating embodied agent model generalization using validation sets hyounghun kim, aishwarya padmakumar, di jin, mohit bansal, dilek hakkani-tür acl 2022 workshop on insights from negative results in nlp 2022 natural language guided embodied task completion is a challenging problem since it requires understanding natural language instructions, aligning them with egocentric visual observations, and choosing appropriate actions to execute in the environment to produce desired changes. we experiment with augmenting a transformer model for this task with modules that effectively utilize a wider field of view and computer vision, helping voice shoppers make purchase decisions gustavo penha, eyal krikon, vanessa murdock, sandeep avula chi 2022 2022 online shoppers have a lot of information at their disposal when making a purchase decision. they can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. voice shopping (purchasing items via a voice assistant such as amazon alexa or google assistant) is different. voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel search and information retrieval, contrastive representation learning for cross-document coreference resolution of events and entities benjamin hsu, graham horwood naacl 2022 2022 identifying related entities and events within and across documents is fundamental to natural language understanding. we present an approach to entity and event coreference resolution utilizing contrastive representation learning. earlier state-of-the-art methods have formulated this problem as a binary classification problem and leveraged large transformers in a cross-encoder architecture to achieve their conversational ai / natural-language processing, scvrl: shuffled contrastive video representation learning michael dorkenwald, fanyi xiao, biagio brattoli, joseph tighe, davide modolo cvpr 2022 workshop on learning with limited labelled data for image and video understanding 2022 we propose scvrl, a novel contrastive-based framework for self-supervised learning for videos. differently from previous contrast learning based methods that mostly focus on learning visual semantics (e.g., cvrl), scvrl is capable of learning both semantic and motion patterns. for that, we reformulate the popular shuffling pretext task within a modern contrastive learning paradigm. we show that our transformer-based computer vision, courtesy of sergey menis amazon scientist sergey menis
