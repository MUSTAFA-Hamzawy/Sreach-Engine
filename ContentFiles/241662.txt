[the middle eastern kingdom has big plans for developing large-scale tourism—starting with jeddah and its centuries-old architecture and history. .&& in saudi arabia’s historic port of jeddah.&& palm trees swing in the breeze against a broad panel of glittering water. egypt and sudan seem to peek over the red sea’s western horizon.&& while mecca lies toward the mountains just behind me. .&& thousands of years old.&& jeddah means “grandmother” in arabic.&& and legend has it that the bible’s eve is buried here. the pilgrim trade and the storied spice highways of the indian ocean all beckoned from jeddah..&& yet.&& saudi arabia is changing fast.&& and part of its vision 2030 plan involves restoring old jeddah. the government’s strategic blueprint for preparing the economy and society for the rigors of a post-petroleum age includes everything from implementing digital and infrastructure projects to liberating women from the constraints of islamic law to nurture a more creative and dynamic workforce. .&& also in the plan: developing large-scale tourism as another source of income. since 2019.&& leisure travelers from 49 countries (including the united states) have been able to apply for visas..&& along with its vast deserts and remarkable archaeological ruins.&& saudi arabia has jeddah—the maritime gateway to the country’s sacred sites—to show off. in all.&& 650 18th- and 19th-century white-plastered.&& coral stone buildings. in al-balad (old jeddah).&& a unesco world heritage site since 2014. now is the time to visit.&& during a magical interlude after it has been refurbished but before the holiday hordes arrive..&& jeddah is the principal city of the hejaz.&& which means the “barrier.&&” a narrow region along the red sea bordered by mountains and plateaus to the east. for centuries.&& muslim pilgrims have come to the hejaz from all over the middle east.&& africa.&& and asia.&& bound for the holy cities of mecca and medina.&& thus making for a form of globalization before the term itself took root. al-balad.&& near the original seventh-century port.&& lies at the heart of it all.&& the first place in arabia that muslim pilgrims saw in the age before jet travel..&& the old town.&& once a hub of the spice trade.&& is a jigsaw of whitewashed buildings decorated with enclosed balconies made of teakwood from india. the balcony screens are cut into lattice formations and called roshans.&& from the persian word rozen.&& meaning “window opening.” here women could sit and see out into the street without being seen themselves. .&& the roshans of jeddah are similar to the moucharaby of tunisia.&& egypt.&& and the levant. their carved complexity is layered against blinding white facades that are striking in their simplicity. no two roshans here are identical.&& yet the architectural pattern throughout the old port appears uniform..&& “we say in arabic that ‘the houses talk to each other.&&’” said abir jameel abusulayman.&& who in 2011 became the first female tour guide in saudi arabia. she took me to meet ahmed angawi.&& who runs a workshop that is reviving the craft of building roshans..&& “latticework in all its variations.&&” angawi told me.&& “represents a geometry that expresses both the unity and diversity of the islamic world.”.&& when not in their natural dark brown teak.&& roshans are painted green or sky blue. green is the color of islam and the kingdom of saudi arabia.&& while blue is inspired by the mushrabiyahs of sidi bou said.&& an urban masterpiece north of tunis on the mediterranean. the effect of the sky blue roshans set against the white walls also conjures up the greek islands.&& and there is one building here called the “mykonos house.” like the greek islands.&& the narrow and somnolent lanes of old jeddah are delightfully populated with cats..&& the smell of incense charms and invigorates the interiors of al-balad.&& as it does throughout the kingdom. i went into a sweet shop.&& its hundreds of clear cases filled with indonesian tamarind seeds.&& dried apricots from syria.&& various dried fruits from thailand.&& dozens of different kinds of dates from saudi arabia.&& and more.&& making for a chromatic and rectilinear feast of color akin to a modern art canvas..&& (learn why the middle east might be the next great hiking destination.).&& i walked into the cool.&& dark interior of nasseef house.&& a 19th-century ottoman mansion where abdelaziz ibn saud lived between 1925 and 1927. then.&& he was known as “king of hejaz.&& sultan of nejd.&&” before the two disparate regions he ruled were officially combined to form saudi arabia in 1932. .&& on the second floor of the house (now a museum).&& i sat by the window where abdelaziz himself must have sat.&& trying to erase the passage of time. without abdelaziz and his galloping.&& warrior charisma.&& the oil giant of saudi arabia would likely have never come into existence and the middle east would now be radically different..&& on the roof there was a wooden enclosure with open windows called a tairama.&& a place for birds.&& according to both abusulayman and rawaa bakhsh.&& a historic preservationist. i rested on a brocade cushion on the floor.&& admiring a view cluttered with glinting-in-the-sun skyscrapers of modern jeddah: a vista that.&& until the 1950s.&& constituted only sea and desert beyond al-balad’s cluster of houses. .&& from here i also spotted the graceful white shafi’i mosque by the old port. its minaret is 800 years old.&& while other parts of the building date to the 18th century. the british intelligence officer t. e. lawrence.&& aka lawrence of arabia.&& must have seen it.&& i thought.&& having begun his arabian adventures from this red sea port in 1916..&& i’ve met saudis over the decades who were educated abroad.&& became members of a globalized world.&& and yet returned home and retained their cultural values: the men still wearing ghutras and agals (traditional saudi arabian headdress and cord).&& the women wearing abayas and hijabs. saudis have become cosmopolitan without becoming rootless. al-balad is at the heart of those roots..&& (could iran’s scenic railway bring back tourism?).&& indeed.&& old jeddah.&& though silent and a bit empty now.&& on account of the final repair work and the fact that it is still a secret.&& promises to become an extension of a young.&& hip coffeehouse culture that is taking over saudi arabia. seventy percent of saudis are under the age of 35.&& and the desert country is 84.3 percent urban. .&& throughout jeddah and riyadh i saw women sitting alone at cafés.&& immersed in their laptops.&& or greeting male or female friends. scenes like these hint at how single female travelers from the west might be received..&& one saudi diplomat.&& having spent many years abroad and now at home in traditional dress.&& told me in an ethiopian coffee shop in al-balad: “according to the stereotypes.&& we have oil.&& we are the land of osama bin laden.&& we repress women.&& and we chop off heads. vision 2030 is trying to undermine those images. now vision 2030.&& of which the restoration of old jeddah is a small part.&& is itself being criticized for its own problems and imperfections. but that’s progress.”.&& copyright © 1996-2015 national geographic societycopyright © 2015-2022 national
