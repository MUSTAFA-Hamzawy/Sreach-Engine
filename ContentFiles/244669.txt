[.&& one of the many fascinating features of our language is how often words with pleasant associations are also quite pleasing on the tongue and even to the eye.&& and how many words.&& by contrast.&& acoustically and visually corroborate their disagreeable nature — look no further than the heading for this post..&& enrich the poetry of your prose by applying words that provide precise connotation while also evoking emotional responses. (note the proportion of beautiful words to ugly ones in the compilation below; it’s easier to conjure the former than the latter.&& though i omitted words associated with bodily functions.&& as well as onomatopoeic terms.).&& notice how often attractive words present themselves to define other beautiful ones.&& and note also how many of them are interrelated.&& and what kind of sensations.&& impressions.&& and emotions they have in common. also.&& try enunciating beautiful words as if they were ugly.&& or vice versa. are their sounds suggestive of their quality.&& or does their meaning wholly determine their effect on us?.&& amorphous: indefinite.&& shapeless beguile: deceive caprice: impulse cascade: steep waterfall cashmere: fine.&& delicate wool chrysalis: protective covering cinnamon: an aromatic spice;

i also seem to remember him having said nice things about the word “gonorrhea.” beauty.&& apparently.&& was indeed more in the eye of that particular beholder than in his other organs..&& great words! how about ‘happenstance’? i used it in an essay once and got a bonus tick on top.&& nice to see the lecturer was a word lover too!.&& i’m a fan of the word ‘aleatory’ (relying on luck or chance)..&& agreed with jojack on recalcitrant! so many harsh sounds in the word makes it really hard on the ears..&& a beautiful word that i think should be added is ‘pendulum’.&& such lovely nasal ‘n’ and ‘m’ sounds that make it so pleasant to hear..&& i thought “iridescent” was an adjective that meant ” shining” or “lustrous”? the abstract noun form of the word is “iridescence” which means “lustre” ….have i got it wrong?.&& i haven’t heard “susurration” being used except in printed text. but have really seen excessive use of “plethora”…..&& my family refers to a certain ugly condition as having the beautiful word. the condition is diarrhea.&& i know these words aren’t meant to be ugly.&& but i detest the words ‘chuckle’ and ‘chortle’. they’re just disgusting words..&& ‘ugliness’ does seem to be related to a word’s meaning. voracious is ugly and so is its meaning. gossamer sounds beautifully light like butterfly wings or fine lace..&& and.&& as the economist magazine’s well-known rules for writers compels us to use the easy word rather than a little-known synonym.&& we are left without ‘crepuscular’ and should use ‘dim’.&& or ‘chance’ instead of ‘serendipitous’. sad!.&& we left out funny words from these excellent lists.&& those that make us laugh. i love some yiddish expressions i grew up with because they sound and feel just right.&& and often mean exactly what we are trying to say. they are also short: klutz (clumsy person); fe (expression of disgust); kvetch (complain); or nu (so?) or no? (in english).&& or ne? (in afrikaans). and how about meh (so what? which is hardly spoken at all except with a twitch of the shoulders)?.&& beautiful – bubble.&& humble.&& awesome.&& honey. ugly- gash.&& crank.&& cot.&& thrush..&& i teach creative writing to high school seniors.&& and one of the first things i have them do is to keep a running list of favorite and least favorite words in the last pages of their journals. (turn to the last page and flip the journal upside down so that you don’t have a sense of writing backwards through the pages.).&& i used to keep a list of only favorite words.&& but i quickly found that my students were interested in those i mentioned as my least favorites.&& including phlegm.&& crusty.&& urinal.&& impressive.&& and prestigious. i find that whatever description i read that employs those last two is sure to turn me away. did you ever enjoy a conversation with someone who talks about her prestigious law firm or his impressive credentials? and bunion is a loathesome word.&& made even worse by earning them from running..&& as for favorites.&& many of mine have to do with affectionate memories and longings.&& to include gallatin valley.&& nova scotia.&& swamp.&& periwinkle (color.&& flower.&& snail).&& river.&& hydrangea.&& hymn.&& hosanna.&& wabash.&& edinburgh..&& once in a while i ask my students to take a word from their list of favorites and start writing. invariably i find that the associations with the word are so powerful that they need no further direction..&& i believe that the word rendezvous is quite beautifull. also beautiful is vanilla.&& bouquet.&& and twilight…..&& i’ve always liked crapulence (intoxication).&& mainly because so many people i have known use it to mean the first four letters..&& makes me wonder if people use it that way the word’s definition may change over time.&& much like aggravate/irritatate..&& vibrant is awesome.&& .&& .&& .&& .&& copyright © 2007 - 2021 daily writing tips . all right

like this, please, i’ve been trying so hard to find lists like this to help expand my vocabulary. as for words to add, “everlong” is quickly becoming one of my favourite words, for a beautiful word. one word that i have always found ugly, though it’s meaning is not, is the word “glowed.” i just despise the sound of it, though it’s most likely because my instinct is to make the past-tense of similar-sounding words ending in -ow to -ew, so that instead of glowed it should be glew.. like blow/blew, know/knew.. but please, oh please, make more lists like this!, ronsteron february 10, 2011 5:47 pm luscious is another beautiful world. what about “nostalgic” as another beautiful word? and perhaps euphoria., lorettaon february 10, 2011 9:30 pm i love this post and will keep it. it includes most of the words that seem the most beautiful to me. i can’t access the list right now, but i like: mellow, lovely, cherubim. yes, i see how the meanings influenced my choices. i can hardly say the words, roach and cockroach. they bring back the extreme disgust i felt as a child when i turned on a light in a garage and a number of the large winged variety flew at me. apart from the insects themselves, i can’t stand those two words. i call the large ones by the other name we use in florida, palmetto bugs, and i call the smaller ones cucarachas. somehow, in spanish it doesn’t sound so bad. i’m actually embarrassed for anyone whose surname is roach, though i’m sure it has nothing to do with the bugs. incidentally, i’m an retired elementary teacher and love wildlife, including most of the smallest kind. i’ve picked up many different kinds of insects, and don’t kill them unless it’s absolutely necessary. i’ve loved spiders since before charlotte’s web was written., tengku shahrizanon february 12, 2011 2:24 am doesn’t “visceral” also mean “instinctive”?, mark nicholon february 12, 2011 3:26 pm tengku: yes, and “deep” and “earthy.” a visceral feeling is a gut feeling, because visceral literally means “guts,” from viscera, a word for the internal organs. i listed only the ugly connotations., sarikaon february 14, 2011 4:16 am beautiful listing! i think ‘eternal’ is a beautiful word too., carolynon march 01, 2011 4:04 pm cool list! thanks for compiling it!, johnny owenson march 09, 2011 2:37 pm i have forgotten the name of the author who published several collections of english language oddities, puzzles, and the like, but he had two favorites which i remember from his own list of “most beautiful words”–zephyr (with which i quite concur) and hemorrhoid (with which i pointedly disagree). as i remember, the “o-r-r-h” orthography seemed to have been a favorite of his, for some reason; i also seem to remember him having said nice things about the word “gonorrhea.” beauty, apparently, was indeed more in the eye of that particular beholder than in his other organs., lizon march 21, 2011 9:45 am great words! how about ‘happenstance’? i used it in an essay once and got a bonus tick on top, nice to see the lecturer was a word lover too!, vendettaon march 29, 2011 12:37 pm i’m a fan of the word ‘aleatory’ (relying on luck or chance)., fgon march 30, 2011 12:56 am agreed with jojack on recalcitrant! so many harsh sounds in the word makes it really hard on the ears. a beautiful word that i think should be added is ‘pendulum’, such lovely nasal ‘n’ and ‘m’ sounds that make it so pleasant to hear., arvind von april 01, 2011 11:53 am i thought “iridescent” was an adjective that meant ” shining” or “lustrous”? the abstract noun form of the word is “iridescence” which means “lustre” ….have i got it wrong? i haven’t heard “susurration” being used except in printed text. but have really seen excessive use of “plethora”…., neilon april 01, 2011 5:32 pm my family refers to a certain ugly condition as having the beautiful word. the condition is diarrhea, gson april 02, 2011 3:55 am i know these words aren’t meant to be ugly, but i detest the words ‘chuckle’ and ‘chortle’. they’re just disgusting words., carol morganon april 02, 2011 7:07 pm ‘ugliness’ does seem to be related to a word’s meaning. voracious is ugly and so is its meaning. gossamer sounds beautifully light like butterfly wings or fine lace. and, as the economist magazine’s well-known rules for writers compels us to use the easy word rather than a little-known synonym, we are left without ‘crepuscular’ and should use ‘dim’, or ‘chance’ instead of ‘serendipitous’. sad! we left out funny words from these excellent lists, those that make us laugh. i love some yiddish expressions i grew up with because they sound and feel just right, and often mean exactly what we are trying to say. they are also short: klutz (clumsy person); fe (expression of disgust); kvetch (complain); or nu (so?) or no? (in english), or ne? (in afrikaans). and how about meh (so what? which is hardly spoken at all except with a twitch of the shoulders)?, little miss squarepantson april 03, 2011 10:40 pm beautiful – bubble, humble, awesome, honey. ugly- gash, crank, cot, thrush., lesley hollowellon april 09, 2011 7:31 pm i teach creative writing to high school seniors, and one of the first things i have them do is to keep a running list of favorite and least favorite words in the last pages of their journals. (turn to the last page and flip the journal upside down so that you don’t have a sense of writing backwards through the pages.) i used to keep a list of only favorite words, but i quickly found that my students were interested in those i mentioned as my least favorites, including phlegm, crusty, urinal, impressive, and prestigious. i find that whatever description i read that employs those last two is sure to turn me away. did you ever enjoy a conversation with someone who talks about her prestigious law firm or his impressive credentials? and bunion is a loathesome word, made even worse by earning them from running. as for favorites, many of mine have to do with affectionate memories and longings, to include gallatin valley, nova scotia, swamp, periwinkle (color, flower, snail), river, hydrangea, hymn, hosanna, wabash, edinburgh. once in a while i ask my students to take a word from their list of favorites and start writing. invariably i find that the associations with the word are so powerful that they need no further direction., stellaon april 11, 2011 7:53 pm i believe that the word rendezvous is quite beautifull. also beautiful is vanilla, bouquet, and twilight…., andyon april 14, 2011 6:34 pm i’ve always liked crapulence (intoxication), mainly because so many people i have known use it to mean the first four letters. makes me wonder if people use it that way the word’s definition may change over time, much like aggravate/irritatate., jojo patatoon april 23, 2011 8:50 pm vibrant is awesome, business writing, book reviews, mistakes, expressions, fiction writing, freelance writing, general, grammar, grammar 101, misused words, punctuation, spelling, style, vocabulary, writing basics, usage review, writing quizzes, home, archives, exercises, about, contact, privacy policy]
