üß°üôèüèºüòä, this app is good and well worth downloading because there are so many of us that are in the same boat and need someone to lean on and talk to. it‚Äôs a great app but now it‚Äôs glitchy to where it takes me to sign in and then when i try i have to tap on the app again after it closes and then it takes me right to where my buddies are and messages with no problems. it was acting fine before the update and now it‚Äôs just too glitchy but i‚Äôll keep using it hope the issues will get taken care of and soon. so for that reason i say it‚Äôs about a three overall a five, hi :) thank you so much for using the app and for your feedback! we are sorry to hear that logging into the app is causing you trouble. please do let us know if you are still having this issue by contacting us at app-feedback@healthline.com - ms buddy engineering team, the very first ms buddy to reach out to me scared me senseless. she called me ‚Äúidiotic‚Äù because the night before, i asked if i was speaking to a robot or a human being. a lot of these apps do use robots and i was so glad to find ms buddy with their real humans... until their real humanity leaked all over the place. now it‚Äôs a mess. i‚Äôm very hesitant to return to the app. if i see this terrible user, i‚Äôll have a deteriorating meltdown. i forgot, i even apologized for the robot question before noon today upon being convinced these really were people. but at 5:30, this user called me ‚Äúidiotic‚Äù for, i‚Äôm guessing, asking questions so that we know if we are getting real support from real people at a time when we need it...badly. i did t download this app because i was bored. but i will delete this app because there is no protection from abusive users. not my cup of tea. and i still have ms!
