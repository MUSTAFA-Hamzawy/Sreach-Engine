international conference on data engineering (icde 2022) 2022 amazon athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows efficiently analyzing large volumes of data stored in amazon s3 using ansi sql. some design choices in the engine, especially those concerning streaming of intermediate results, can result in suboptimal executions for query patterns that have common expressions. in this paper we build upon recent work and introduce new optimizations in cloud and systems, trade-offs in sampling and search for early-stage interactive text classification zachary levonian, chia-jung lee, vanessa murdock, f. maxwell harper intelligent user interfaces conference 2022 for many automated classification tasks, collecting labeled data is the key barrier to training a useful supervised model. interfaces for interactive labeling tighten the loop of labeled data collection and model development, enabling a subject-matter expert to quickly establish the feasibility of a classifier to address a problem of interest. these interactive machine learning (iml) interfaces iteratively information and knowledge management, rose: robust caches for amazon product search chen luo, vihan lakshman, anshumali shrivastava, tianyu cao, sreyashi nag, rahul goutam, hanqing lu, yiwei song, bing yin the web conference 2022 2022 product search engines like amazon search often use caches to improve the customer user experience; caches can improve both the system’s latency as well as search quality. however, as search traffic increases over time, the cache’s ever-growing size can diminish the overall system performance. furthermore, typos, misspellings, and redundancy widely witnessed in real-world product search queries can cause related: more-efficient caching for product retrieval search and information retrieval, oa-mine: open-world attribute mining for e-commerce products with weak supervision xinyang zhang, chenwei zhang, xian li, xin luna dong, jingbo shang, christos faloutsos, jiawei han the web conference 2022 2022 automatic extraction of product attributes from their textual descriptions is essential for online shopper experience. one inherent challenge of this task is the emerging nature of e-commerce products — we see new types of products with their unique set of new attributes constantly. most prior works on this matter mine new values for a set of known attributes but cannot handle new attributes that arose information and knowledge management, practicing moderation: community moderation as reflective practice amanda l.l. cullen, sanjay r. kairam 2022 many types of online communities rely on volunteer moderators to manage the community and maintain behavioral standards. while prior work has shown that community moderators often develop a deep understanding of the goals of their moderation context and sophisticated processes for managing disruptions, less is known about the processes through which moderators develop this knowledge. in this paper, we leverage information and knowledge management, combining knowledge graphs, quickly and accurately hao wei march 19, 2020 novel cross-graph-attention and self-attention mechanisms enable state-of-the-art performance. information and knowledge management, amazon at wsdm: the future of graph neural networks larry hardesty february 17, 2022 amazon’s george karypis will give a keynote

nick little accelerating parallel training of neural nets pranav ladkat september 05, 2019 earlier this year, we reported a speech recognition system trained on a million hours of data, a feat possible through semi-supervised learning, in which training data is annotated by machines rather than by people. these sorts of massive machine learning projects are becoming more common, and they require distributing the training process across multiple processors. otherwise, training becomes too time consuming. machine learning, about, research areas, blog, news and features, publications,
