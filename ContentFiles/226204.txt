[, data structure and algorithms course practice problems on bit magic ! recent articles on bit magic !, the bitwise algorithms are used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. the bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program., for example: to check if a number is even or odd. this can be easily done by using bitwise-and(&) operator. if the last bit of the operator is set than it is odd otherwise it is even. therefore, if num & 1 not equals to zero than num is odd otherwise it is even., topic
