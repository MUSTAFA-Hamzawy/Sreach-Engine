coastal cities and offshore development may shine deep enough to disrupt tiny critters living dozens of meters (yards) below the surface., eyes in the sky show many of the worst methane emitters are in countries that produce a lot of oil and gas, such as russia and the united states., en el informe de la onu se vinculan directamente las temperaturas extremas, lluvias e incendios en todo el mundo

that would speed the glacier’s slip into the ocean, boosting a rise in sea levels., a fossilized family gathering of long-necked mussaurus from 193 million years ago is the earliest evidence yet of herd behavior in dinos., ink analysis reveals the hidden words of marie antoinette's letters and who tried to hide them., a bone crucial for lift-off was stronger in hatchling pterosaurs than in adults. the baby reptiles also had shorter, broader wings than grown-ups., it links extreme weather around the globe to earth’s changing climate., ct scans of 99-million-year-old fossils of hummingbird-sized specimens trapped in amber reveal a number of lizardlike features., new fossil evidence shows 90 percent of sharks died in the mysterious event., new ‘climate normals’ show that
