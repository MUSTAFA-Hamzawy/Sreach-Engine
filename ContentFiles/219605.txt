[built-in intents (biis) model some of the common ways that users express tasks they're trying to do or information they seek, such as ordering a meal, booking a ride, or checking an account balance., building app actions requires you to implement built-in intents. when building app actions, we recommend implementing and testing all biis related to your in-app functionality. by doing so, you can provide a better experience for users who want to trigger app actions for your app., the built-in intent reference contains the following information about each built-in intent:, except as otherwise
