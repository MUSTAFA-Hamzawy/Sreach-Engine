[we’ve all heard the advice, don’t judge a book by its cover. but then how should we go about identifying books which are good for us? the secret depends on understanding two things:, we can’t easily answer the second question without understanding the first one. but we can help by being good library listeners and trying to provide tools, such as the reading log and lists, to help patrons record and discover books they like. since everyone is different, the second question is key to understanding why patrons like these books and making open library as useful as possible to patrons., as we’ve explored before, determining whether something is a book is a deceptively difficult task, even for librarians. it’s a bound thing made of paper, right? but what about audiobooks and ebooks? ok, books have isbns right? but many formats can have isbns and books published before 1967 won’t have one. and what about yearbooks? is a yearbook a book? is a dictionary a book? what about a phonebook? a price guide? an atlas? there are entire organizations, like the san francisco center for the book, dedicated to exploring and pushing the limits of the book format., in some ways, it’s easier to answer this question about humans than books because every human is built according to a specific genetic blueprint called dna. we all have dna, what make us unique are the variations of more than 20,000 genes that our dna are made of, which help encode for characteristics like hair and eye color. in 1990, an international research group called the human genome project (hgp) began sequencing the human genome to definitively uncover, “nature’s complete genetic blueprint for building a human being”. the result, which completed in 2003, was a compelling answer of, “what is a human?”., nine years later, will glaser & tim westergren drew inspiration from hgp and launched a similar effort called the music genome project, using trained experts to classify and label music according to a taxonomy of characteristics, like genre and tempo. this system became the engine which powers song recommendations for pandora radio., circa 2003, aaron stanton, matt monroe, sidian jones, and dan bowen adapted the idea of pandora to books, creating a book recommendation service called booklamp. under the hood, they devised a book genome project which combined computers and crowds to “identify, track, measure, and study the multitude of features that make up a book”., their system analyzed books and surfaced insights about their structure, themes, age-appropriateness, and even pace, bringing us withing grasping distance of the answer to our question: what is a book?, sadly, the project did not release their data, was acquired by apple in 2014, and subsequently discontinued. but they left an exciting treasure map for others to follow., and follow, others did. in 2006, a project called the open music genome project attempted to create a public, open, community alternative to pandora’s music genome project. we thought this was a beautiful gesture and a great opportunity for open library; perhaps we could facilitate public book insights which any project in the ecosystem could use to create their own answer for, “what is a book?”. we also found inspiration from complimentary projects like storygraph, which elegantly crowd sources book tags from patrons to help you, “choose your next book based on your mood and your favorite topics and themes”, haithitrust research center (htrc) which has led the way in making book data available to researchers, and the open syllabus project which is surfacing useful academic books based on their usage across college curriculum., over the last several months, we’ve been talking to communities, conducting research, speaking with some of the teams behind these innovative projects, and building experiments to shape a non-profit adaptation of these approaches called the open book genome project (obgp)., our hope is that this open book genome project will help responsibly make book data more useful and accessible to the public: to power book recommendations, to compare books based on their similarities and differences, to produce more accurate summaries, to calculate reading levels to match audiences to books, to surface citations and urls mentioned within books, and more., obgp hopes to achieve these things by employing a two pronged approach which readers may continue learning about in following two blog posts:, or hear an overview of the obgp in this half-hour tech talk:][the open book genome project, what is a book?, introducing the open book genome project, search, recent posts, archives]the open book genome project[genes, open, open, readers may continue learning about in following two blog posts, the, sequencer, bot, community reviews, crowd-sourced][about, what is a book?, what are our preferences?, the sequencer – a community-engineered bot which reads millions of internet archive books and extracts key insights for public consumption., community reviews – a new crowd-sourced book tagging system which empowers readers to collaboratively classify & share structured reviews of books., , search, , recent posts a high schooler’s experience contributing to the open book genome project introducing trusted book providers open library in every language 2021 end-of-year community updates how one volunteer is sharing a better reading experience with all of us, a high schooler’s experience contributing to the open book genome project, introducing trusted book providers, open library in every language, 2021 end-of-year community updates, how one volunteer is sharing a better reading experience with all of us, archives archives select month april 2022 december 2021 november 2021 october 2021 september 2021 august 2021 june 2021 december 2020 october 2020 september 2020 august 2020 july 2020 may 2020 november 2019 october 2019 january 2019 october 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 march 2018 december 2017 october 2016 june 2016 may 2016 february 2016 january 2016 november 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 april 2013 january 2013 august 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008]
