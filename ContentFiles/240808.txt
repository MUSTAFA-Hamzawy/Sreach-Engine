[.&& what is worklife?.&& how we work.&& how we live.&& how we think.&& more.&& when the wray opened in washington.&& dc’s fashionable foggy bottom neighbourhood in may 2021.&& it was one of the buzziest real-estate projects of the year. not only did the eight-storey apartment complex have bold art deco designs in its grand lobby.&& but also a rooftop terrace overlooking the dc skyline with fire pits and grills as well as a penthouse clubroom with a lounge and private meeting space. .&& for residents of the neighbourhood.&& it was quite a surprise to see this world war two-era building transformed into 158 luxury apartments. it was.&& after all.&& filled just two years earlier with foreign-policy makers dissecting diplomatic cables at offices run by the us state department..&& the wray is just one of several work buildings in the washington dc area that have been adapted into residential space. according to a recent report from rental listings site rentcafe.&& the us capital has converted more offices to housing since the start of the pandemic than anywhere else in the nation.&& with 1.&&091 new units. neighbouring city alexandria.&& virginia.&& meanwhile.&& is right behind with 955 new units. .&& a decade ago.&& factories and hotels were the prime targets for adaptive reuse. now.&& former offices comprise 41% of all us apartments converted during the past two years.&& according to rentcafe. they are also the most popular building type for future adaptive reuse projects.&& creating one-quarter of the 52.&&700 residential units expected to become available in the us in 2022 (a figure that’s up from 6.&&960 in 2012)..&& remote-work and hybrid schemes have led companies to reduce the footprint of their offices.&& lowering demand and increasing supply. meanwhile.&& the heated housing market has left developers eager to transform ageing assets into prime residential real estate..&& this adaptive reuse has the potential to revitalise central business districts (cbds).&& which have been devastated by the pandemic.&& as well as upend outdated assumptions about how to design cities. yet the roadblocks – such as tax codes and zoning restrictions – are many.&& meaning it won’t always be an easy transition. just as adapting homes into offices required major changes.&& so.&& too.&& will turning offices into homes..&& at the wray in washington.&& dc.&& the eight-storey apartment complex has a penthouse club with a lounge and bar (credit: kip dawkins).&& north america’s dying downtowns.&& the trend of turning ageing offices into residential buildings isn’t just happening in the us. for instance.&& the greater paris investment agency launched a design competition for office-to-housing conversions..&& yet.&& the need for such conversions is greatest in north america. in asia.&& remote work hasn’t taken off to the same extent as in the west.&& leaving less office stock available for adaptive reuse. in europe or latin america.&& business districts were typically built outside historic centres.&& shielding the mixed-use downtown core from the biggest effects of changing workplace trends (even if canary wharf is empty.&& for example.&& central london still buzzes with life). on the contrary.&& north america has high concentrations of office buildings – many of which have outdated infrastructure and technology – located at the very heart of its cities..&& tracy hadden loh.&& a fellow at the washington-based brookings institution.&& who researches commercial real-estate trends.&& says that if you look at the top 10 office markets in the us.&& you’ll find about 90% office space in the cbd.. “there’s basically nothing else there.&&” she explains. “so.&& when office workers started working from home.&& these cbds emptied like a mining town out west after the gold ran dry.”.&& office occupancy was trending downwards in many markets long before the pandemic.&& as employers abandoned aging buildings constructed during a building boom in the 1980s and began to consume fewer square feet per worker. cities have known this posed a threat to their downtowns for a while..&& “this trend [of office to residential conversions] really started to pick up in 2019.&& and it gained acceptance right about the time of the pandemic.&&” says doug ressler.&& manager of business intelligence at yardi matrix.&& the real-estate data company that put together the rentcafe report. “most conversions are happening in urban core areas where the housing demand is greatest and the ability to convert is.&& too.”.&& the exterior of the franklin tower in philadelphias logan square neighbourhood (credit: robert deitchler/gensler).&& in calgary.&& bad offices make good residences.&& there is.&& perhaps.&& no city in the world that has taken on the challenge of converting outdated office stock into residential units as aggressively as calgary in canada..&& “calgary was.&& kind of in a bad way.&& ahead of the trend.&&” explains steven paynter.&& principal in the toronto office of architectural design firm gensler. the company worked with calgary’s economic development group in summer 2020 to develop a plan to combat an office vacancy rate hovering around 32% – double that of detroit’s when it declared bankruptcy in 2013. .&& “the pandemic was the line in the sand when they realised they weren’t going to bounce back unless they did something pretty invasive and forward-thinking.&&” says paynter.&& noting that the city “had about six million square feet of office they wanted to take out of the market.&& and about 12 million square feet of total vacancy”..&& gensler worked with calgary to develop a scorecard for converting offices to residential dwellings.&& looking at things like location (was it central and highly accessible?) and shape (narrow buildings with shorter core to window depths are easier to convert). using these metrics.&& it found that about 35% of the buildings were top candidates for financially viable conversions..&& calgary had a target of 50%. to achieve that.&& it created a cash incentive of cad$75 ($58; £47) per square foot (up to a maximum of cad$10m per property to make the economics easier for developers. it also took away the red tape on rezoning.&& cutting about 18 months off the lifecycle of projects from start to finish.&& according to paynter. the result: new projects in development are expected to increase calgary’s downtown population by about 24%. .&& “it really is an opportunity to create a more modern city within the existing fabric of a downtown.&&” says paynter. gensler is now using the method developed in calgary to score several us cities as well as to work with individual developers in major chinese markets..&& many office-to-apartment conversions have luxury amenities.&& like rooftop decks with views.&& like at the franklin tower (credit: robert deitchler/gensler).&& the effects of repopulating a cbd.&& changes like the one underway in calgary will be necessary to breathe new life into downtown sectors that have lain barren since the onset of the pandemic. a report from the mastercard economics institute.&& the research division of the credit-card company.&& showed spending in small- and medium-sized businesses in cbds – including coffee shops.&& dry-cleaners and corner stores – was down 33% in 2021 compared to 2019 levels.&& while similar retailers in residential areas saw an 8% increase..&& the pandemic has made it abundantly clear that variety within a cbd is a key determinant of its resilience. “it’s like an investment portfolio.&&” says loh. “central business districts need to diversify.&& in order to reduce their risk exposure to the future of work trends.”.&& adding more housing downtown can also help revive struggling public transit systems.&& which in almost all north american cities “are over-engineered to serve suburban to downtown work trips for white-collar workers”.&& says loh.&& noting that remote and hybrid work have left buses and trains empty..&& though most office-to-residential conversions have been for higher-end units (often due to the large cost involved in making projects viable).&& there has been a push to use this opportunity to create more affordable housing. the mayer building.&& for example.&& is an art deco landmark in downtown los angeles that’s currently being converted into affordable housing with 79 income-restricted apartments..&& “the people who need affordable housing are also the people who.&& for opportunity reasons.&& need to be in highly accessible locations that are well-served by transit.&&” says loh. “so.&& there is a strong equity and location-efficiency argument for looking at affordable housing supply and adaptive reuse.”.&& the final reason many cities are now looking to repurpose their office buildings is that construction contributes an estimated 11% to global carbon emissions.&& according to non-profit organisation architecture 2030.&& and adaptive reuse can cut that by up to 80%. .&& with environmental.&& financial and equity concerns all at play.&& this trend is only expected to accelerate now that cities around the world are emerging from the pandemic and assessing the health of their altered downtowns..&& update 11 may 2022: an innaccurate reference to a plan by the city of london was removed from this
