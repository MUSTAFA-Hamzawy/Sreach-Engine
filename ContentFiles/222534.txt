[a variable is something that can be changed — such as the value represented by a letter a math equation, or a factor in an experiment., deimagine/getty images, by maria temming, 3 hours ago, the word “variable” can be an adjective or a noun. as an adjective, it means able to vary, or change. as a noun, the word refers to something that can be changed. that thing may be a quantity that can take on different values. or, it may be a factor in an experiment that someone changes., in math, a variable is a symbol that stands in for an unknown value. it is usually a letter, such as x or y. a variable’s value changes depending on the context. solving the equation x + 1 = 3, for instance, finds that x = 2. in the equation x + 2 = 5, meanwhile, x = 3. and in the equation x + 1 = y, plugging in different values for x results in different values for y., science experiments also involve variables. in an experiment, a person can change one thing and see how that may impact another thing. the factor that a person changes is the independent variable. the thing that may change in response to that is the dependent variable. but a dependent variable may be affected by other things, too. so, a scientist tries to keep those external factors — or controlled variables — constant. that way, they won’t impact the experiment’s outcome., in a study of the five-second rule, the independent variable is how long food lies on the floor., check out the full list of scientists say., weekly updates to help you use science news for students in the learning environment, thank you for signing up!, there was a problem signing you up., constant: continuous or uninterrupted. (in mathematics) a number that is known and unchanging, usually based on some mathematical definition. for example, π (pi) is a constant equal to 3.14. . . and defined as the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter., dependent variable: the factor, or variable, that changes in response to the independent variable. in an experiment, a researcher changes or controls the independent variable, then observes whether and how that change affects the dependent variable or variables. for instance, a baker might want to know the role eggs play in a cake recipe. to find out, they could bake one cake with eggs, and one cake without. then, they would measure and compare variables such as cake height or how crumbly is its texture. in this example, the presence or absence of eggs is the independent variable. cake height and texture are dependent variables: they depend on the status of the independent variable., equation: in mathematics, the statement that two quantities are equal. in geometry, equations are often used to determine the shape of a curve or surface., factor: something that plays a role in a particular condition or event; a contributor., independent variable: the factor, or variable,  that a person changes in an experiment to determine whether and how this variable affects other variables. for instance, a baker might want to know the role eggs play in a cake recipe. to find out, they could bake one cake with eggs, and one cake without. then, they could measure and compare factors such as cake height or how crumbly is its texture in this example, the presence or absence of eggs is the independent variable. cake height and texture are dependent variables: they depend on the status of the independent variable., variable: (in mathematics) a letter used in a mathematical expression that may take on different values. (in experiments) a factor that can be changed, especially one allowed to change in a scientific experiment. for instance, when researchers measure how much insecticide it might take to kill a fly, they might change the dose or the age at which the insect is exposed. both the dose and age would be variables in this experiment., maria temming is the assistant editor at science news for students.
