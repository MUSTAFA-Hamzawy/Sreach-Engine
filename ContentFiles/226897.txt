[, sandi from inspiration for writers wrote to ask:, “can you do a segment on past vs. passed–if you haven’t already? too many get these words mixed up.”, very happy to oblige, sandi!, the word past locates something in time, and sometimes in space. it can be used as an adjective, noun, or adverb., “past” as an adjective, the first definition which the oed gives for past as an adjective is “gone by in time; elapsed; done with; over.” for example:, when attributed to a group of people, past can also mean “having served one’s term of office; former.” (oed), and in grammar, we have more examples of past being used as an adjective, such as in “past tense” and “past participle”., “past” as a noun, the main meaning for the noun form of past, given by the oed, is “the time that has gone by; a time, or all of the time, before the present.”, “past” as a preposition, as a preposition, past can mean: “beyond in time; after; beyond the age for or time of; (in stating the time of day) so many minutes, or a quarter or half of an hour, after a particular hour.” (oed), it can also be used for location: “beyond in place; further on than; at or on the further side of; to a point beyond.” (oed), “past” as an adverb, the first meaning the oed cites for past being used as an adverb is “so as to pass or go by; by.” for example:, passed is the past participle of the verb “to pass”. it can be an intransitive verb (one which doesn’t require an object) or a transitive verb (one which requires both a subject and one or more objects)., “to pass” means “to proceed, move forward, depart; to cause to do this.” (oed) this can refer to movement forwards in time, in space, or in life (such as “to pass an examination”)., for example:, often, writers muddle the words past and passed in sentences such as:, it’s common to see this written as:, but the word should be passed, as (in this sentence) it’s the past participle of the verb “to pass”. an easy way to tell is to rewrite the sentence in the present tense, as though you’re describing something which is happening currently:, however, if you wrote:, it’s correct to use past. the verb in this sentence is “walked”, and the “past” is acting as an adverb., most of the time, passed is a verb, as described above. there are a few occasions when it can be used as a noun or an adjective, though. for example:, have you come across any other unusual uses? are there still any cases where you’re not sure whether to use passed or past? share your examples with us in the comments below!, the words “past” and “passed” are homonyms (or homophones): they sound alike, but they’re two different words. this makes it easy to confuse them when writing – just like people often confuse the words “there”, “their” and “they’re”., it doesn’t help that “past” and “passed” have quite similar meanings, each referring to movement relating to a fixed point (in time, space, or even life). this means it’s a lot easier to muddle them up than it is with some other homonyms with very different meanings, like “blue” and “blew”., for a whole list of homonyms that commonly get confused, check out 25 confused homonym pairs., if you’re still struggling with “past” and “passed”, remember, “past” can’t be used as a verb., if you find it hard to identify a verb, try replacing “passed” with the words “went by”, and see if your sentence works:, the heroes passed a village on their way towards the mountains., the heroes went by a village on their way towards the mountains., time passed slowly that afternoon., time went by slowly that afternoon., (this won’t work in every case – e.g. “he passed his exams” won’t sound right as “he went by his exams” – but it’ll help you a lot of the time.), alternatively, as mentioned above, you can rewrite the sentence in the present tense, as though it’s happening right now., sometimes, it’s helpful to take a look at some examples so you can double-check if you’re using “past” and “passed” the right way:, right: he ran straight past the bus stop. (“past” is acting as a preposition here and could be replaced with the word “by”), wrong: he ran straight passed the bus stop. (“passed” can’t be a preposition.), —, right: he passed the bus stop on his run. (“passed” is a past-tense verb here and could be replaced with “went by”.), wrong: he past the bus stop on his run. (“past” can’t be a verb.), —, right: she passed the time by reading a novel. (here, “passed” is a transitive verb and “time” is the direct object.), wrong: she past the time by reading a novel. (“past” can’t be a verb.), —, right: it is past the time you should be home. (“past” is a preposition here. you could replace it with “after” or “beyond”.), wrong: it is passed the time you should be home. (“passed” can’t be a preposition.), hopefully this helps clear up any “past” vs “passed” confusion for you., for each sentence, select whether “past” or “passed” is correct., 1. the time [past/passed] slowly that afternoon., 2. if i had a time machine, i’d rather travel to the future than the [past/passed]., , 3. the bus will arrive at half [past/passed] six., 4. my friend [past/passed] all her exams., , , , , want to improve your english in five minutes a day?

i see it both ways. the former feels like one passed or got beyond something and left it behind in the past!, this is confusing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, ……given the approximate eight (8) months that have passed since we last communicated on this matter., this was part of the sentence that the word “passed” was questioned. i feel “past” is the correct term. please help me out here., so would it be i biked this passed weekend? or i biked this past weekend?, thanks for the help!, if you are telling someone that they are too late to do something, do you say “your time to do this has past” or “passed”? or does it matter?, cindy, it’s is passed as in “you time to do this has passed”. since you are using it as a verb, it is passed not past., hailey, the correct word is “past”, since you are using it as an adjective., hope this helps., am i correctly using passed and past in the following expression:, what’s passed is past., (note: what’s means what has), i hope you can help me. i have been asked to write a sign. the organisation has asked for a sign to stop cars driving any further. they would like the sign to say: no cars passed this point please, i think it should say: no cars past this point please. which one is right?, hi neil,, you are correct. it should be “no cars past this point please.”, hope that helps,, ali, boy i hope i passed this test befor it to late and the test has pass me by?, hi george,, that sentence should be:, “boy, i hope i passed this test before it’s too late and the test has passed me by.”, “pass” is the present tense form of the very “to pass”, and you want the past form (“passed”)., if you want to use “past” and “pass2 in your sentence, you could write, “boy, i hope i passed this test before it’s past the time to pass.” (i don’t think that’s the greatest sentence in the world, but it’s grammatically correct!, i was wondering when to use the word “pass” or “past” when using it in a sentence dealing with someone or something that had died., for example:, barbara recently passed away. or should it be barbara recently past away., ?? =/, hi phong,, it should be “barbara recently passed away.”, i am a little unsure of which to use in this sentence: “if we notice that the expiry date of your credit card has past, we will automatically contact you.” passed or past?, how about this?, for the “past” few days, should it be past or passed?, sally, passed is the correct word. when you use a helping verb [has], your next word is a verb [passed]., cherie, your sentence is similar to hailey’s. past is correct, because it’s acting as an adjective. or adverb. one of the two., which is correct, it is passed the deadline or it is past the deadline?, it tastes good if you can get past the looks. past or passed?, my grandson & i made some cookies for my son-in-law in iraq. i told him “if he could get passed the looks of the cookies, they would taste great”. my daughter said it was past. which is correct?, mike, it is passed the deadline…, would i be: “i passed out as soon as the liquor took hold of my senses.”, or,, “i past out as soon as the liquor took hold of my senses.”, ?, which is correct?, i need to run something past/passed you., ten minutes passed and so i decided…, is this correct or does it need to be past?, which is correct?, los angeles is lovely once you get past the insane traffic., or, los angeles is lovely once you get passed the insane traffic., if everyone in the world associates a place with communism and communism alone, tourists will never be able to look (past or passed) that and see the good in the country and all it has to offer., which one?, help…. should this read,”half the length of the truck was past the white line” or “half of the length of the truck was passed the white line?”, which is correct: passed or past?, the car that past you had passed the intersection first., which is corect: passed or past? the car that past you had passed the intersection first?, if i’m getting this correctly, i think with a lot of the unanswered examples posted, if you use the trick mentioned above about trying to say it in the present tense, then you can figure it out. if it makes sense in the present tense as “pass”, then it should be “passed”. if it doesn’t make sense as “pass” then it should be past. (though if it’s an unusual case, that could behave differently.), such as,, los angeles is lovely once you get pass/passing the insane traffic. — doesn’t make sense, so it should be: los angeles is lovely once you get past the insane traffic., it tastes good if you can get pass/passing the looks. — doesn’t make sense, so it should be: it tastes good if you can get past the looks., but if you reworded it to say, “i am passing the looks of the cookies and enjoying the taste.” you could use “i have passed…”, also: “i passed out as soon as the liquor took hold of my senses” is correct because it also works as: “i pass out as soon as the liquor takes a hold of my senses.”, please correct me if i’m wrong!!, it seems like syntax and tense have a huge influence. let me give five examples of saying the same thing:, 1. “i have gone past the deadline” vs. “i have gone passed a deadline”. the latter is correct., 2. “i am past the deadline” vs. “i am passed” the deadline. the former is correct., both sets of above sentences clearly mean the exact same thing, but use different homonyms., 3. “the deadline has passed” vs. “the deadline has past”. the former is correct., 4. “the deadline is in the passed” vs. the deadline is in the past”. the latter is correct., once again, both sets of sentences clearly mean the exact same thing but use different homonyms., interestingly, you can be correct with both of the following:, 5. “it is a passed deadline” or “it is a past deadline”. the former means the deadline has gone by (similar to the “passed ball” or “passed pawn”), the latter means the deadline existed in a prior time (i.e. it is in the past)., past vs passed, as the months past or as the months passed, is it correct to say, “how does the food always get passed the bib? or past the bib”?, which one is the correct sentence, he’s going to past out when he gets home?, he’s going to passed out when he gets home?, jennifer, neither of those are correct. it should be: he’s going to pass out when he gets home. the sentence is future tense, not past tense. if it was in past tense it would be: he passed out when he got home., i get the “change to present tense” and the heroes passing by the village, but what if the heroes are stationary?, “the carriage trundled past the heroes” or “the carriage trundled passed the heroes”, ?? thanks! – emery, please clarify the difference between past-[office holder] and former-[office holder]., i know that one refers to the person who held office immediately preceding the current office holder and the other refers to all those preceding the current office holder – but which is which?, is g.w. bush our past-president and g.h. bush a former- president, or vice versa?, emery, it should be “the carriage trundled past the heroes” it is used as an adverb. the verb is “trundled” and the adverb is “past.”, michael, g.w. is both “past” and “former;” while g.h. can only be “former”, “past” is the one immediately preceding the current., so i see the use of “immediate past president.” is this redundant and should be just “past president?”, i want to know which word to use in the following sentence…, “i looked passed/past his appearance…” um i guess “i look passing his appearance” (puttting it in the present tense doesn’t work) so i guess it’s “past”….right?, how about “the report came from a driver who was driving “passed” the scene of the accident?, or should it be past or pass? =|, daniel: 1. “i have gone past the deadline” vs. “i have gone passed a deadline”. the latter is correct., you are incorrect & slightly correct. “i have gone past the deadline.” past” describes how far gone, so it is an adverb. this sentence is correct., “i have gone passed a deadline.” the wording “have gone passed” is grammatically incorrect. it sounds more like country slang. this sentence would be correct if it said, “i have passed a deadline.” the key difference here is the articles in each sentence: the first sentence refers to “the” deadline & the second refers to “a” deadline., i think that pass is more of an action word., past is more about time. with the exception of a postion that was served by someone, such as, past president., >> dave on august 26, 2009 8:52 am >> >> how about “the report came from a driver who was >> driving “passed” the scene of the accident?, the report came from a driver who was driving past the scene of the accident., hopefully, after he drove past the accident, he pulled over to use a phone to report the accident, he had just passed. the victims of the

or past the bib”?, jenniferon july 01, 2009 3:23 am which one is the correct sentence he’s going to past out when he gets home? he’s going to passed out when he gets home?, kleptoon july 25, 2009 6:55 pm jennifer, neither of those are correct. it should be: he’s going to pass out when he gets home. the sentence is future tense, not past tense. if it was in past tense it would be: he passed out when he got home., emeryon august 01, 2009 1:03 am i get the “change to present tense” and the heroes passing by the village, but what if the heroes are stationary? “the carriage trundled past the heroes” or “the carriage trundled passed the heroes” ?? thanks! – emery, michaelon august 01, 2009 4:20 pm please clarify the difference between past-[office holder] and former-[office holder]. i know that one refers to the person who held office immediately preceding the current office holder and the other refers to all those preceding the current office holder – but which is which? is g.w. bush our past-president and g.h. bush a former- president, or vice versa?, dandy abesamison august 03, 2009 7:18 pm emery, it should be “the carriage trundled past the heroes” it is used as an adverb. the verb is “trundled” and the adverb is “past.” michael, g.w. is both “past” and “former;” while g.h. can only be “former” “past” is the one immediately preceding the current., sandy24on august 14, 2009 3:21 pm so i see the use of “immediate past president.” is this redundant and should be just “past president?”, romyon august 24, 2009 11:47 pm i want to know which word to use in the following sentence… “i looked passed/past his appearance…” um i guess “i look passing his appearance” (puttting it in the present tense doesn’t work) so i guess it’s “past”….right?, daveon august 26, 2009 8:52 am how about “the report came from a driver who was driving “passed” the scene of the accident? or should it be past or pass? =|, christinaon september 14, 2009 4:08 am daniel: 1. “i have gone past the deadline” vs. “i have gone passed a deadline”. the latter is correct. you are incorrect & slightly correct. “i have gone past the deadline.” past” describes how far gone, so it is an adverb. this sentence is correct. “i have gone passed a deadline.” the wording “have gone passed” is grammatically incorrect. it sounds more like country slang. this sentence would be correct if it said, “i have passed a deadline.” the key difference here is the articles in each sentence: the first sentence refers to “the” deadline & the second refers to “a” deadline., gregon september 14, 2009 1:32 pm i think that pass is more of an action word. past is more about time. with the exception of a postion that was served by someone, such as, past president., ruffertoon september 28, 2009 7:26 am >> dave on august 26, 2009 8:52 am >> >> how about “the report came from a driver who was >> driving “passed” the scene of the accident? the report came from a driver who was driving past the scene of the accident. hopefully, after he drove past the accident, he pulled over to use a phone to report the accident, he had just passed. the victims of the accident wished they had passed that place without incident – or without it’s set of dents – but that’s all in the past, now. just don’t let accidents become part of your future., arton october 02, 2009 9:02 pm which one: we have already (past, passed) that down., dandy abesamison october 04, 2009 2:34 am >> sandy24 on august 14, 2009 3:21 pm >> so i see the use of “immediate past president.” is this redundant >> and should be just “past president?” >> sandy, yes “past president” is more proper. == >> romy on august 24, 2009 11:47 pm >> i want to know which word to use in the following sentence… >> “i looked passed/past his appearance…” >> um i guess “i look passing his appearance” >> (puttting it in the present tense doesn’t work) >> so i guess it’s “past”….right? romy, that’s correct. “past” == >> art on october 2, 2009 9:02 pm >> which one: >> we have already (past, passed) that down. art, it’s “passed.” it’s used as a transitive verb in that sentence., ajon october 05, 2009 4:09 am that was very helpful, thank you. i actually found several misuses of “passed” in my own writing, which have been fixed., jillon october 27, 2009 9:44 pm which is correct, ‘we have passed our initial deadline, or we have past our initial deadline?’ thanks,, business writing, book reviews, mistakes, expressions, fiction writing, freelance writing, general, grammar, grammar 101, misused words, punctuation, spelling, style, vocabulary, writing basics, usage review, writing quizzes, home, archives, exercises, about, contact, privacy policy]
