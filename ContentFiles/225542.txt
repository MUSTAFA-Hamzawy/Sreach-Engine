automation, robotic manipulation, the role of pretrained representations for ood generalization of rl agents frederik trauble, andrea dittadi, manuel wüthrich, felix widmaier, peter gehler, ole winther, francesco locatello, olivier bachem, bernhard schölkopf, stefan bauer iclr 2022 2022 building sample-efficient agents that generalize out-of-distribution (ood) in real-world settings remains a fundamental unsolved problem on the path towards achieving higher-level cognition. one particularly promising approach is to begin with low-dimensional, pretrained representations of our world, which should facilitateefficient downstream learning and generalization. by training 240 representations machine learning, spherical harmonic covariance and magnitude function encodings for beamformer design mike luo 2022 microphone and speaker array designs have increasingly diverged from simple topologies due to diversity of physical host geometries and use cases. effective beamformer design must now account for variation in the array’s acoustic radiation pattern, spatial distribution of target and noise sources, and intended beampattern directivity. relevant tasks such as representing complex pressure fields, specifying robotics, radio-frequency interference estimation for multiple random noise sources ling zhang, haochen yang, xiangrui su, qiaolei huang, jagan rajagopalan, deepak pai, chulsoon hwang, jun fan ieee transactions on electromagnetic compatibility 2022 as more compact designs and more assembled function modules are utilized in modern electronic devices, radiofrequency interference (rfi) source reconstruction is becoming more challenging because different noise sources may contribute simultaneously. this article presents a novel methodology to reconstruct multiple random noise sources on a real-world product, including several double-data-rate (ddr) memory robotics, embodied bert: a transformer model for embodied, language-guided visual task completion alessandro suglia, qiaozi gao, jesse thomason, govind thattai, gaurav s. sukhatme emnlp 2021 workshop on novel ideas in learning-to-learn through interaction 2021 language-guided robots performing home and office tasks must navigate in and interact with the world. grounding language instructions against visual observations and actions to take in an environment is an open challenge. we present embodied bert (embert), a transformer-based model which can attend to high-dimensional, multi-modal inputs across long temporal horizons for language-conditioned task completion conversational ai / natural-language processing, scene generation from backgrounds to objects and anything in between: a deep learning robotics survey bouchra bouqata, krishna aswani, david bailey arab women in computing 2021 the recent rapid progress of deep learning algorithms in generating realistic images, especially in generative adversarial networks (gan) and variational auto-encoders (vae), has helped advance new applications. examples of such applications range from generating and manipulating new synthetic data for self-driving cars, to building/urban architectures, to interior design, and gaming.
