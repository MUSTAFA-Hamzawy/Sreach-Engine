[the pending sale of twitter to elon musk has generated a buzz about the future of social media and just who should control our data..&& wendy hanamura.&& director of partnerships at the internet archive.&& moderated an online discussion april 28 “goodbye facebook.&& hello decentralized social media?” about the opportunities and dangers ahead. the webinar is part of a series of six workshops.&& “imagining a better online world: exploring the decentralized web.” .&& watch the session recording:.&& the session featured founders of some of the top decentralized social media networks including jay graber.&& chief executive officer of r&d project bluesky.&& matthew hodgson.&& technical co-founder of matrix.&& and andre staltz.&& creator of manyverse. unlike twitter.&& facebook or slack.&& matrix and manyverse have no central controlling entity. instead the peer-to-peer networks shift power to the users and protect privacy. .&& if twitter is indeed bought and people are disappointed with the changes.&& the speakers expressed hope that the public will consider other social networks. “a crisis of this type means that people start installing manyverse and other alternatives.&&” staltz said. “the opportunity side is clear.” still in the transition period if other platforms are not ready.&& there is some risk that users will feel stuck and not switch.&& he added..&& hodgson said there are reasons to be both optimistic and pessimistic about musk purchasing twitter. the hope is that he will use his powers for good.&& making it available to everybody and empowering people to block the content they don’t want to see. the risk is with no moderation.&& hodgson said.&& people will be obnoxious to one another without sufficient controls to filter.&& and the system will melt down. “it’s certainly got potential to be an experiment. i’m cautiously optimistic on it.&&” he said..&& people who work in decentralized tech recognize the risk that comes when one person can control a network and act for good or bad.&& graber said. “this turn of events demonstrates that social networks that are centralized can change very quickly.&&” she said. “those changes can potentially disrupt or drastically alter people’s identity.&& relationships.&& and the content that they put on there over the years. this highlights the necessity for transition to a protocol-based ecosystem.” .&& when a platform is user-controlled.&& it is resilient to disruptive change.&& graber said. decentralization enables immutability so change is hard and is a slow process that requires a lot of people to agree.&& added staltz..&& the three leaders spoke about how decentralized networks provide a sustainable alternative and are gaining traction. unlike major players that own user data and monetize personal information.&& decentralized networks are controlled by users and information lives in many different places..&& “society as a whole is facing a lot of crises.&&” graber said. “we have the ability to.&& as a collective intelligence.&& to investigate a lot of directions at once. but we don’t actually have the free ability to fully do this in our current social architecture…if you decentralize.&& you get the ability to innovate and explore many more directions at once. and all the parts get more freedom and autonomy.”.&& decentralized social media is structured to change the balance of power.&& added hanamura: “in this moment.&& we want you to know that you have the power. you can take back the power.&& but you have to understand it and understand your responsibility.”.&& the webinar was co-sponsored by dweb and library futures.&& and presented by the metropolitan new york library council (metro)..&& the next event in the series.&& decentralized apps.&& the metaverse and the “next big thing.&&” will be held thursday.&& may 26 at 4-5 p.m.est.&& register here.&& .&& join us on tuesday.&& may 31st at 6pm pt / 9pm et for a fireside chat with congressman ro khanna in conversation with harvard professor and author lawrence lessig to discuss rep. khanna’s book.&& dignity in a digital age: making tech work for all of us..&& in the bay area?

can be susceptible to the dynamic nature of social media.&&  such  as  hashtags  associated  with  surges  in  popularity.  we  drew  inspiration  from the ecologically-based shannon diversity index (sdi) to create a more representative and  resilient  method  of  semantic  hierarchy  construction  that  relies  upon  graph-based community detection and a novel.&& entropy-based ensemble diversity index (edi) score. the edi quantifies the contextual diversity of each hashtag.&& resulting in thousands of semantically-related groups of hashtags organized along a general-to-specific spectrum. through an application of edi to social media data (twitter) and a comparison of our results to prior approaches.&& we demonstrate our method’s ability to create semantically consistent hierarchies that can be flexibly applied and adapted to a range of use cases..&& emmanouil tranos (university of bristol).&& while geographers first turned their focus on the internet 25 years ago.&& the wealth

1http://data.webarchive.org.uk/opendata/ukwa.ds.2/.&& at a recent webinar hosted by the internet archive.&& leaders from the biodiversity heritage library (bhl) shared how its massive open access digital collection documenting life on the planet is an invaluable resource of use to scientists and ordinary citizens..&& “the bhl is a global consortium of the  leading natural history museums.&& botanical gardens.&& and research institutions — big and small— from all over the world. working together and in partnership with the internet archive.&& these libraries have digitized more than 60 million pages of scientific literature available to the public”.&& said chris freeland.&& director of open libraries and moderator of the event..&& established in 2006 with a commitment to inspiring discovery through free access to biodiversity knowledge.&& bhl has 19 members and 22 affiliates.&& plus 100 worldwide partners contributing data. the bhl has content dating back nearly 600 years alongside current literature that.&& when liberated from the print page.&& holds immense promise for advancing science and solving today’s pressing problems of climate change and the loss of biodiversity..&& martin kalfatovic.&& bhl program director and associate director of the smithsonian libraries and archives.&& noted in his presentation that charles darwin and colleagues famously said “the cultivation of natural science cannot be efficiently carried on without reference to an extensive library.”.&& “today.&& the biodiversity heritage library is creating this global.&& accessible open library of literature that will  help scientists.&& taxonomists.&& environmentalists—a host of people working with our planet—to actually have ready access to these collections.&&” kalfatovic said. bhl’s mission is to improve research methodology by working with its partner libraries and the broader biodiversity and bioinformatics community. each month.&& bhl draws about 142.&&000 visitors and 12 million users overall..&& “the outlook for the planet is challenging. by unlocking this historic data [in the biodiversity heritage library].&& we can find out where we’ve been over time to find out more about where we need to be in the future.”.&& most of the bhl’s materials are from collections in the global north.&& primarily in large.&& well-funded institutions. digitizing these collections helps level the playing field.&& providing researchers in all parts of the world equal access to vital content..&& the vast collection includes species descriptions.&& distribution records.&& climate records.&& history of scientific discovery.&& information on extinct species.&& and records of scientific distributions of where species live. to date.&& bhl has made over 176.&&000 titles and 281.&&000 volumes available. through a partnership with the global names architecture project.&& more than 243 million instances of taxonomic (latin) names have been found in bhl content..&& kalfatovic underscored the value of bhl content in understanding the environment in the wake of recent troubling news from the sixth assessment report (ar6) published by the  intergovernmental panel on climate change about the impact of the earth’s warming. .&& “the outlook for the planet is challenging.&&” he said. “by unlocking this historic data.&& we can find out where we’ve been over time to find out more about where we need to be in the future.”.&& jj dearborn.&& bhl data manager.&& discussed how digitization transforms physical books into digital objects that can be shared with “anyone.&& at any time.&& anywhere.” she describes the wikimedia ecosystem as “fertile ground for open access experimentation.&&” crediting the organization with giving bhl the ability to reach new audiences and transform its data into 5-star linked open data. “dark data” that is locked up in legacy formats.&& jp2s.&& and ocr text are sources of valuable checklist.&& species occurrence.&& and event sampling data that the larger biodiversity community can use to improve humanity’s collective ability to monitor biodiversity loss and the destructive impacts of climate

transform human understanding if it could be truly utilized.&&” she said. “it might represent a gestalt leap for humanity.” .&& the event was the fifth in a series of six sessions highlighting how researchers in the humanities use the internet archive. the final session of the library as laboratory series will be a series of lightning talks on may 11 at 11am pt / 2pm et—register now!.&& watching a single episode of the evening news can be informative. tracking trends in broadcasts over time can be fascinating. .&& the internet archive has preserved nearly 3 million hours of u.s. local and national tv news shows and made the material open to researchers for exploration and non-consumptive computational analysis. at a webinar april 13.&& tv news archive experts shared how they’ve curated the massive collection and leveraged technology so scholars.&& journalists and the general public can make use of the vast repository..&& roger macdonald.&& founder of the tv news archive.&& and kalev leetaru.&& collaborating data scientist and gdelt project founder.&& spoke at the session. chris freeland.&& director of open libraries.&& served as moderator and internet archive founder brewster kahle offered opening remarks..&& “growing up in the television age.&& [television] is such an influential.&& important medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote.&&” kahle said. “we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.” .&& the internet archive built on the work of the vanderbilt television archive.&& and the ucla library broadcast newsscape to give the public a broader “macro view.&&” said kahle. the trends seen in at-scale computational analyses of news broadcasts can be used to understand the bigger picture of what is happening in the world and the lenses through which we see the world around us..&& in 2012.&& with donations from individuals and philanthropies such as the knight foundation.&& the archive started repurposing the closed captioning data stream required of all u.s. broadcasters into a search index. “this simple approach transformed the antiquated experience of searching for specific topics within video.&&” said macdonald.&& who helped lead the effort. “the tv caption search enabled discovery at internet speed with the ability to simultaneously search millions of programs and have your results plotted over time.&& down to individual broadcasters and programs.”.&& “[television] is such an influential.&& important medium—persuasive.&& yet not something you can really quote. we wanted to make it so that you could quote.&& compare and contrast.”.&& scholars and journalists were quick to embrace this opportunity.&& but the team kept experimenting with deeper indexing. techniques like audio fingerprinting.&& optical character recognition (ocr) and computer vision made it possible to capture visual elements of the news and improve access.&& macdonald said. .&& sub-collections of political leaders’ speeches and interviews have been created.&& including an extensive donald trump archive. some of the archive’s most productive advances have come from collaborating with outsiders who have requested more access to the collection than is available through the public interface.&& macdonald said. with appropriate restrictions to maintain respect for broadcasters and distribution platforms.&& the archive has worked with select scientists and journalists as partners to use data in the collection for more complex analyses..&& treating television news as data creates vast opportunities for computational analysis.&& said leetaru. researchers can track word frequency use in the news and how that has changed over time.  for instance.&& it’s possible to look at mentions of covid-related words across selected news programs and see when it surged and leveled off with each wave before plummeting downward.&& as shown in the graph below..&& the newly computed metadata can help provide context and assist with fact checking efforts to combat misinformation. it can allow researchers to map the geography of television news—how certain parts of the world are covered more than others.&& leetaru said. through the collections.&& researchers have explored  which presidential tweets challenging election integrity got the most exposure on the news.  ocr of every frame has been used to create models of how to identify names of every “dr.” depicted on cable tv after the outbreak of covid-19 and calculate air time devoted to the medical doctors commenting on one of the virus variants.  reverse image lookup of images in tv news has been used to determine the source of photos and videos.  visual entity search tools can even reveal the increasing prevalence of bookshelves as backdrops during home interviews in the pandemic.&& as well as appearances of books by specific authors or titles. open datasets of computed tv news metadata are available that include all visual entity and ocr detections.&& 10-minute interval captioning ngrams and second by second inventories of each broadcast cataloging whether it was “news” programming.&& “advertising” programming or “uncaptioned” (in the case of television news this is almost exclusively advertising)..&& from television news to digitized books and periodicals.&& dozens of projects rely on the collections available at archive.org for computational and bibliographic research across a large digital corpus. data scientists or anyone with questions about the tv news archives.&& can contact

saved.&& and how many of them are controlled by a large.&& corporate platform instead of by you? last month’s “keeping your personal data personal: how decentralized identity drives privacy” session started with that provocative question in order to illustrate the potential of this emerging technology..&& self-sovereign identity (ssi).&& defined as “an idea.&& a movement.&& and a decentralized approach for establishing trust online.&&” sits in the middle of the stack of technologies that makes up the decentralized internet. in the words of the decentralized identity resource guide written specifically for this session.&& “self-sovereign identity is a system where users themselves–and not centralized platforms or services like google.&& facebook.&& or linkedin–are in control and maintain ownership of their personal information.”.&&   research shows that the average american has more than 150 different accounts and passwords – a number that has likely skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic. in her presentation.&& wendy hanamura.&& director of partnerships at the internet archive.&& discussed the implications of “trading privacy and security for convenience.” hanamura drew on her recent experience at sxsw.&& which bundled her personal data.&& including medical and vaccine data.&& into an insecure qr code used by a corporate sponsor to verify her as a participant. in contrast.&& hanamura says that the twenty-year old concept of self-sovereign identity can disaggregate these services from corporations.&& empowering people to be in better control of their own data and identity through principles like control.&& access.&& transparency.&& and consent. while self-sovereign identity presents incredible promise as a concept.&& it also raises fascinating technical questions around verification and management..&& for kaliya “identity woman” young.&& her interest in identity comes from networks of global ecology and information technology.&& which she has been part of for more than twenty years. in 2000.&& when the internet was still nascent.&& she joined with a community to ask: “how can this technology best serve people.&& organizations.&& and the planet?” underlying her work is the strong belief that people should have the right to control their own online identity with the maximum amount of flexibility and access. using a real life example.&& young compared self-sovereign identity to a physical wallet. like a wallet.&& self-sovereign identity puts users in control of what they share.&& and when.&& with no centralized ability for an issuer to tell when the pieces of information within the wallet is presented..&& in contrast.&& the modern internet operates with a series of centralized identifiers like icann or iana for domain names and ip addresses and corporate private namespaces like google and facebook. young’s research and work decentralizes this way of transmitting information through “signed portable proofs.&&” which come from a variety of sources rather than one centralized source. these proofs are also called verifiable credentials and have metadata.&& the claim itself.&& and a digital signature embedded for validation. all of these pieces come together in a digital wallet.&& verified by a digital identifier that is unique to a person. utilizing cryptography.&& these identifiers would be validated by digital identity documents and registries. in this scenario.&& organizations like incommon.&& an access management service.&& or even a professional licensing organization like the american library association can maintain lists of institutions that would be able to verify the identity or organizational affiliation of an identifier. in the end.&& young emphasized a message of empowerment – in her work.&& self-sovereign identity is about “innovating protocols to represent people in the digital realm in ways that empower them and that they control.”.&& next.&& librarian lambert heller of technische bibliothek and irene adamski of the berlin-based ssi firm jolocom discussed and demonstrated their work in creating self-sovereign identity for academic conferences on a new platform called condidi. this tool allows people running academic events to have a platform that issues digital credentials of attendance in a decentralized system. utilizing open source and decentralized software.&& this system minimizes the amount of personal information that attendees need to give over to organizers while still allowing participants to track and log records of their attendance. for libraries.&& this kind of system is crucial – new systems like condidi help libraries protect user privacy and open up platform innovation..&& self-sovereign identity also utilizes a new tool called  a “smart wallet.&&” which holds one’s credentials and is controlled by the user. for example.&& at a conference.&& a user might want to tell the organizer that she is of age.&& but not share any other information about herself. a demo of jolocom’s system demonstrated how this system could work. in the demo.&& irene showed how a wallet could allow a person to share just the information she wants through encrypted keys in a conference situation. jolocom also allows people to verify credentials using an encrypted wallet. according to adamski.&& the best part of self sovereign identity is that “you don’t have to share if you don’t want to.” this way.&& “i am in control of my data.”.&& to conclude.&& heller discussed a recent movement in europe called “stop tracking science.” to combat publishing oligopolies and data analytics companies.&& a group of academics have come together to create scholar-led infrastructure. as heller says.&& in the current environment.&& “your journal is reading you.&&” which is a terrifying thought about scholarly communications..&& these academics are hoping to move toward shared responsibility and open.&& decentralized infrastructure using the major building blocks that already exist. one example of how academia is already decentralized is through pids.&& or persistent identifiers.&& which are already widely used through systems like orcid. according to heller.&& these pids are “part of the commons” and can be shared in a consistent.&& open manner across systems.&& which could be used in a decentralized manner for personal identity rather than a centralized one. to conclude.&& heller said.&& “there is no technical fix for social issues. we need to come up with a model for how trust works in research infrastructure.”.&& it is clear that self-sovereign identity holds great promise as part of a movement for technology that is privacy-respecting.&& open.&& transparent.&& and empowering. in this future.&& it will be possible to have a verified identity that is held by you.&& not by a big corporation – the vision that we are setting out to achieve. want to help us get

how technology has shaped our society. in his latest book.&& whole earth: the many lives of stewart brand (on-sale now).&& markoff delivers the definitive biography of one of the most influential visionaries to inspire the technological.&& environmental.&& and cultural revolutions of the last six decades..&& today stewart brand is largely known as the creator of the whole earth catalog.&& a compendium of tools.&& books.&& and other intriguing ephemera that became a counterculture bible for a generation of young americans during the 1960s. he was labeled a “techno-utopian” and a “hippie prince”.&& but markoff’s whole earth shows that brand’s life’s work is far more. in 1966.&& brand asked a simple question—why we had not yet seen a photograph of the whole earth? the whole earth image became an optimistic symbol for environmentalists and replaced the 1950s’ mushroom cloud with the ideal of a unified planetary consciousness. but after the catalog.&& brand went on to greatly influence the ‘70s environmental movement and the computing world of the ‘80s. steve jobs adopted brand’s famous mantra.&& “stay hungry.&& stay foolish” as his code to live by.&& and to this day brand epitomizes what markoff calls “that california state of mind.”.&& brand has always had an “eerie knack for showing up first at the onset of some social movement or technological inflection point.&&” markoff writes.&& “and then moving on just when everyone else catches up.” brand’s uncanny ahead-of-the-curveness is what makes john markoff his ideal biographer. markoff has covered silicon valley since 1977.&& and his reporting has always been at the cutting edge of tech revolutions—he wrote the first account of the world wide web in 1993 and broke the story of google’s self-driving car in 2010. stewart brand gave markoff carte blanche access in interviews for the book.&& so markoff gets a clearer story than has ever been set down before.&& ranging across brand’s time with the merry pranksters and his generation-defining whole earth catalog.&& to his fostering of the marriage of environmental consciousness with hacker capitalism and the rise of a new planetary culture..&& above

covid-19 pandemic was the focus of an investigation by tim ribaric and researchers at brock university in ontario, canada. using fully extracted texts from websites of municipal governments, community organizations and others, the team compared how well information was conveyed to the public. the analysis assessed four facets of communication: resilience, education, trust and engagement. the data set was used to teach senior communication students at the university about digital scholarship, ribaric said, and the team is now finalizing a manuscript with the results of the analysis., watch: shana macdonald from the university of waterloo in ontario canada applied archival web data to do a comparative analysis of feminist media tactics over time. the project mapped the presence of feminist key concepts and terms to better understand who is using them and why. the researchers worked with the archives unleashed team to capture information from relevant websites, write code and analyze the data. they found the top three terms used were “media, culture and community,” macdonald said, providing an interesting snapshot into trends with language and feminism., watch: at the university of siegen, a public research university in germany, researchers examined the online commenting system on new websites from 1996 to 2021.  online media outlets started to remove commenting systems in about 2015 and the project was focused on this time of disruption. with the rise of web 2.0 and social media, commenting is becoming increasingly toxic and taking away from the main text, said the university’s robert jansma. technology providers have begun to offer ways to stem the tide of these unwanted comments and, in general, the team discovered comments are not very well preserved., watch: web archives of the covid-19 crisis through the iipc novel coronavirus dataset was analyzed by a team at the university of luxembourg led by valérie schafer. as a shared, unforeseen, global event, the researchers found vast institutional differences in web archiving. looking at tracking systems from the u.s. library of congress, european libraries and others, the team did not see much overlap in national collections and are in the midst of finalizing the project’s results., watch: researchers at arizona state university worked with arch tools to compare health misinformation circulating during the hiv/aids crisis and covid-19 pandemic.  asu’s shawn walker did a text analysis to link patterns and examine how gaps in understanding of health crises can fuel misinformation. in both cases, the community was trying to make sense of information in an uncertain environment. however, the government conspiracy theories rampant in the covid-19 pandemic were not
