gold.&&” a long-term store of value that would resist broader economic trends and provide a hedge against inflation..&& but bitcoin’s crashing price over the last month shows that vision is a long way from reality. instead.&& traders are increasingly treating the cryptocurrency like just another speculative tech investment..&& since the start of this year.&& bitcoin’s price movement has closely mirrored that of the nasdaq.&& a benchmark that’s heavily weighted toward technology stocks.&& according to an analysis by the data firm arcane research. that means that as bitcoin’s price dropped more than 25 percent over the last month.&& to under $28.&&000 on thursday — less than half its november peak — the plunge came in near lock step with a broader collapse of tech stocks as investors grappled with higher interest rates and the war in ukraine..&& the growing correlation helps explain why those who bought the cryptocurrency last year.&& hoping it would grow more valuable.&& have seen their investment crater. and while bitcoin has always been volatile.&& its increasing resemblance to risky tech stocks starkly shows that its promise as a transformative asset remains unfulfilled..&& “it delegitimizes the argument that bitcoin is like gold.&&” said vetle lunde.&& an analyst for arcane. “evidence points in favor of bitcoin just being a risk asset.”.&& arcane research assigned a numeric score between 1 and -1 to capture the pricing correlation between bitcoin and the nasdaq. a score of 1 indicated an exact correlation.&& meaning the prices moved in tandem.&& and a score of -1 represented an exact divergence..&& since jan. 1.&& the 30-day average of the bitcoin-nasdaq score has approached 1.&& reaching 0.82 this week.&& the closest it had ever been to an exact.&& one-to-one correlation. at the same time.&& bitcoin’s price movement has diverged from fluctuations in the price of gold.&& the asset to which it has been most often compared..&& the convergence with the nasdaq has grown over the course of the coronavirus pandemic.&& driven partly by institutional investors like hedge funds.&& endowments and family offices that have poured money into the cryptocurrency market..&& unlike the idealists who drove the initial enthusiasm for bitcoin in the 2010s.&& these professional traders are treating the cryptocurrency as part of a larger portfolio of high-risk.&& high-reward tech investments. some of them are under pressure to secure short-term returns for clients and are less ideologically committed to bitcoin’s long-term potential. and when they lose faith in the tech industry more broadly.&& that affects their bitcoin trades..&& “five years ago.&& people who were in crypto were crypto people.&&” said mike boroughs.&& a founder of the blockchain investment fund fortis digital. “now you’ve got guys who are across the whole span of risk assets. so when they’re getting hit over there.&& it’s impacting their psychology.”.&& worries in the stock market — affected by challenging economic trends.&& including russia’s invasion of ukraine and the historic levels of inflation — have particularly manifested themselves in falling tech stocks this year. meta.&& the company formerly known as facebook.&& is down more than 40 percent this year. netflix has lost 70 percent of its value..&& on wednesday.&& shares of coinbase.&& the cryptocurrency exchange.&& plummeted 26 percent after it reported declining revenue and a loss of $430 million in the first quarter. the company’s stock has fallen more than 75 percent overall this year..&& the nasdaq is already in bear-market territory.&& having ended wednesday down 29 percent from its mid-november record. november was also when bitcoin’s price hit a

bitcoin.&& which trades every day.&& are based on the latest value of the day in coordinated universal time. nasdaq and gold markets generally are open monday through friday..&& source: coinmarketcap and factset.&& by the new york times.&& “there was this undeniable retail belief that bitcoin at the end of last year was an inflation hedge — it was a safe haven.&& it was going to replace the dollar.&&” said ed moya.&& a cryptocurrency analyst at the trading company oanda. “and what happened was inflation started to become very ugly.&& and bitcoin lost half of its value.”.&& the prices of other cryptocurrencies have also been crushed. the price of ether.&& the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency.&& has dropped about 25 percent just since early april.&& to under $2.&&300. others.&& like
