[, , , cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. sometimes this process goes wrong. new cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. these extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. tumors can be benign or malignant. benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. they can also break away and spread to other parts of the body., cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. there are more than 100 different types of cancer. most cancers are named for where they start. for example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation., nih: national cancer institute, the information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice. contact a health care provider if you have questions about your health.][cancer, basics, learn more, see, play and learn, research, resources, for you, summary, start here, diagnosis and tests, prevention and risk factors, treatments and therapies, living with, related issues, specifics, genetics, videos and tutorials, statistics and research, clinical trials, journal articles references and abstracts from medline/pubmed (national library of medicine), reference desk, find an expert, children, men, women, older adults, patient handouts, topic image, stay connected, medical encyclopedia, related health topics, national institutes of health, other languages, nih medlineplus magazine, disclaimers]cancer: medlineplus[][health topics, drugs & supplements, genetics, medical tests, videos & tools, about medlineplus, about medlineplus, what's new, site map, customer support, health topics, drugs & supplements, genetics, medical tests, videos & tools, summary, start here, diagnosis and tests, prevention and risk factors, treatments and therapies, living with, related issues, specifics, genetics, videos and tutorials, statistics and research, clinical trials, journal articles, reference desk, find an expert, children, men, women, older adults, patient handouts, cancer (american academy of family physicians), cancer basics (american cancer society) also in spanish, what is cancer?
