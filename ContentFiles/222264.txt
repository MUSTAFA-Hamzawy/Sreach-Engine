[the science of lying shows that most people don’t lie often. but when they do, it takes a surprising toll on their brains., over time, the pleasure disappears and craving grows. that craving causes stress that can drive people to use drugs or pursue unhealthy behaviors again and again., when people see imaginary faces in everyday objects, those faces are more likely to be perceived as male than female., in an experiment, people who fell into a shallow sleep were more likely than non-sleepers or deep sleepers to discover a sly math trick., a simple change by publishers and web designers could help kids — both with and without dyslexia — read faster and better., teens may find it hard to avoid screen time, but data from a new study suggest it can speed their recovery., five finalists in the broadcom masters middle-school competition reveal how they created nationally competitive projects., check out the real-life vampires and zombies of the animal kingdom, and learn why people think ghosts and mummy curses are real., most head impacts while playing football do not cause concussions. yet even lesser impacts take a toll in young athletes, scans of their brains show., some studies find students don’t learn as well by reading on screens as from paper. but that's not always true. here’s how to make the most of reading in either format., founded in 2003, science news for students
