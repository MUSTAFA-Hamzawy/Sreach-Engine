[machine learning (ml) is basically that field of computer science with the help of which computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings do. in simple words, ml is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. the key focus of ml is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention., this tutorial will be useful for graduates, postgraduates, and research students who either have an interest in this subject or have this subject as a part of their curriculum. the reader can be a beginner or an advanced learner. this tutorial has been prepared for the students as well as professionals to ramp up quickly. this tutorial is a stepping stone to your machine learning journey., the reader must have basic knowledge of artificial intelligence. he/she should also be aware of python, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib. if you are new to any of these concepts, we recommend you to take up tutorials concerning these topics, before you dig further into this tutorial., 168 lectures 13.5 hours, er. himanshu vasishta, 64 lectures 10.5 hours, eduonix learning solutions, 91 lectures 10 hours, abhilash nelson, 54 lectures 6 hours, abhishek and pukhraj, 49 lectures 5 hours, abhishek and pukhraj, 35 lectures 4 hours, abhishek and pukhraj, , we make use of cookies to improve our user experience. by using this website, you agree with our cookies policy. agree learn more][machine learning with python tutorial, audience, prerequisites, useful video courses]machine learning with python tutorial[][academic tutorials big data & analytics computer programming computer science databases devops digital marketing engineering tutorials exams syllabus famous monuments gate exams tutorials latest technologies machine learning mainframe development management tutorials mathematics tutorials microsoft technologies misc tutorials mobile development java technologies python technologies sap tutorials programming scripts selected reading software quality soft skills telecom tutorials upsc ias exams web development sports tutorials xml technologies multi-language interview questions, academic tutorials, big data & analytics, computer programming, computer science, databases, devops, digital marketing, engineering tutorials, exams syllabus, famous monuments, gate exams tutorials, latest technologies, machine learning, mainframe development, management tutorials, mathematics tutorials, microsoft technologies, misc tutorials, mobile development, java technologies, python technologies, sap tutorials, programming scripts, selected reading, software quality, soft skills, telecom tutorials, upsc ias exams, web development, sports tutorials, xml technologies, multi-language, interview questions, machine learning with python, home, basics, python ecosystem, methods for machine learning, data loading for ml projects, understanding data with statistics, understanding data with visualization, preparing data, data feature selection, ml algorithms - classification, introduction, logistic regression, support vector machine (svm), decision tree, naïve bayes, random forest, ml algorithms - regression, random forest, linear regression, ml algorithms - clustering, overview, k-means algorithm, mean shift algorithm, hierarchical clustering, ml algorithms - knn algorithm, finding nearest neighbors, performance metrics, automatic workflows, improving performance of ml models, improving performance of ml model (contd…), ml with python - resources, machine learning with python - quick guide, machine learning with python - resources, machine learning with python - discussion, selected reading, upsc ias exams notes, developer's best practices, questions and answers, effective resume writing, hr interview questions, computer glossary, who is who, print,  add notes,  bookmark this page,  report error,  suggestions, about us, refund policy, terms of use, privacy policy, faq's, contact]
