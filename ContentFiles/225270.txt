[advertisement, the new york timesupdated may 9, 2022, this chart shows how average daily cases per 100,000 people have changed in different parts of the country. the state with the highest recent average cases per 100,000 people is shown., see more details ›, update for may 6, update for may 6, see more details ›, this table is sorted by places with the most cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days. charts show change in daily averages and are each on their own scale. select a table header to sort by another metric., each chart shows how these three metrics compare to the corresponding peak level reached nationwide before omicron became the dominant variant. for example, a state’s case line exceeds 100 percent on the chart when its number of cases per capita exceeds the highest number of u.s. cases per capita reached in january 2021., data from the centers for disease control and prevention shows that people who are unvaccinated are at a much greater risk than those who are fully vaccinated to die from covid-19. these charts compare age-adjusted average daily case and death rates for vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the states and cities that provide this data., , , this chart shows for each age group the number of people per 100,000 that were newly admitted to a hospital with covid-19 each day, according to data reported by hospitals to the u.s. department of health and human services., these are days with a reporting anomaly. read more here., this table is sorted by places with the most cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days. charts show change in daily averages and are each on their own scale. select a table header to sort by another metric., the times has identified reporting anomalies or methodology changes in the data., confirmed cases and deaths, which are widely considered to be an undercount of the true toll, are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a molecular laboratory test. probable cases and deaths count individuals who meet criteria for other types of testing, symptoms and exposure, as developed by national and local governments., governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. the times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when possible. for agencies that do not report data every day, variation in the schedule on which cases or deaths are reported, such as around holidays, can also cause an irregular pattern in averages. the times uses an adjustment method to vary the number of days included in an average to remove these irregularities., by jordan allen, sarah almukhtar,
