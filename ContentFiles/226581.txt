[cbse class 12 mathematics notes, which are written in simple language, cover nearly all of the chapters of class 12th mathematics. preparing from these notes will assist students in achieving high grades in their 12th grade as well as successful tests such as jee mains and jee advanced. these notes provided by geeksforgeeks will help students understand each concept and revise thoroughly before the tests. these notes were written by content experts, and have a major advantage in that students would be well prepared to answer some kind of question that could be asked in the exams., , the chapter relation and functions discuss the introduction of relations and functions, types of relation, types of functions, the composition of functions and invertible function, binary operations., inverse trigonometric functions gives an account of various topics such as the graphs of inverse trigonometric functions, different properties of inverse trigonometric functions, along with their domain, range, and other important attributes.  , this chapter provides crucial knowledge of matrices that have applications in different areas such as business, sales, cost estimation, etc. in this chapter, the study of various properties of matrices, elementary row and column operations in matrices, invertible matrices, transpose of a matrix, and identity matrix are discussed. , this chapter is a continuation of the previous chapter of matrices. this chapter helps to learn about the determinants, their properties, how determinants can be used to calculate the area of a triangle, and in solving a system of linear equations. , this chapter is a continuation of the concepts learned in the previous class, differentiation of polynomial and trigonometric functions. now here in this class, the difference is that the level of the problems and the introduction of the two theorems given by rolle and lagrange. , this chapter deals with applications of derivatives which helps to learn how to determine the rate of change of quantities, find the minimum and maximum values of a function, and equations of tangents and normals to a curve., in this chapter, the methods to determine the function when its derivative is given and the area under a graph of a function are discussed. basic properties of integrals and the fundamental theorem of calculus are also included in this chapter. , this chapter included topics like how to find the area of different geometrical figures such as circles, parabolas, and ellipses. , in this chapter, the concepts of differential equations and how to find solutions to a differential equation are discussed. this topic holds various applications in physics, economics, chemistry, and biology. ,  in this chapter, the concepts of vector quantities, how to find the position vector of a point, geometrical interpretation of vectors, and scalar and cross product of vectors are discussed. these concepts have great importance in higher education (engineering and technology)., based on the vector algebra discussed in the previous chapter, here are the concepts like, how it can be applied to three-dimensional geometry. also, the introduction to topics like direction cosines and direction ratios, cartesian and vector equations of a line, and how to find the shortest distance between two lines using these concepts are discussed in this part. , this chapter is a continuation of the concepts of linear inequalities and the system of linear equations in two variables studied in the previous class. this chapter helps to learn how these concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems and how to optimize the problems of linear programming so that one can maximize resource utilization, minimize profits, etc. , this chapter deals with probability, the concept of probability are also studied in earlier classes. this chapter in the present class helps to learn about conditional probability. further, the topics like bayes’ theorem, independence of events, the probability distribution of random variables, mean and variance of a probability distribution, and binomial distribution are discussed in this chapter. , writing code in
