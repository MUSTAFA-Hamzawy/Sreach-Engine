[help center, , imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. , the simplest way to explain it is that although we accept and consider all votes received by users, not all votes have the same impact (or ‘weight’) on the final rating. , when unusual voting activity is detected, an alternate weighting calculation may be applied in order to preserve the reliability of our system. , to ensure that our rating mechanism remains effective, we do not disclose the exact method used to generate the rating. , see also the complete faq for imdb ratings., imdb general support][weighted average ratings]imdb | help[][imdb.com, imdbpro.com, lists faq, watchlist faq, how do i submit my rating on imdb?, ratings faq, how can i see all my ratings?, how do i share my review?, how do i sort my ratings by the title type?, weighted average ratings, the vote average for film "x" should be y! why are you displaying another rating?, what’s the difference between the moviemeter and popularity ranking on a title?, how do i change or delete my rating on a title?, how do i change the privacy setting for my ratings?, why do the user ratings on many movies and tv shows seem to decrease over time?, how can i view the breakdown of ratings?, who are the top 1000 voters? how do i know if i'm one of them?, what does it mean if i found a user review helpful or not?, how do i create a link in one of my descriptions?, can i use your ratings on my website?, need more help? visit the official imdb support community powered by sprinklr., issues logging in to imdb? get login help.]
