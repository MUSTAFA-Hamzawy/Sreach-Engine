[reviews.&& contributor.&& an excellent cup of coffee does not require pressurization.&& steaming wands.&& or a thousand-dollar machine. your morning caffeine fix can be satisfied with a cup of french press coffee.&& a bold.&& rich result that you can achieve in the comfort of your home in just a few minutes (more or less.&& depending on how you take your joe)..&& it’s worth understanding how a french press works.&& given that it’s a simple and effective way to brew an excellent cup of coffee..&& there are three key components: the carafe (the container that holds the coffee).&& the plunger.&& and the filter. to make french press coffee.&& you add coarsely ground coffee and hot water to the carafe and let the mixture sit. the exact amount of time for your brew will vary depending on how strong you like your coffee and what variety of coffee you’re using.&& but it’s usually a few minutes. serious eats suggests six to eight minutes for truly coarse-ground coffee. after the extraction period.&& press the plunger down to separate the coffee from the grounds. it’s best to serve french press coffee right away.&& as it will continue to extract flavor while it sits in the carafe.  .&& different kinds of french presses have different levels of filtration.&& explains giorgio milos.&& master barista at italian coffee company illy. “a simple device has a metal plunger that allows some of the grounds (the finest particles) to pass through the mesh.&& resulting in some sediment in your cup. for this type of french press you must pour out all the coffee once you complete the steeping.” other more technical french presses have a complex filtration system that involves a plastic o-ring and a plastic membrane that doesn’t allow grounds to pass through and separates the coffee grounds from the water completely..&& “the most important thing to look for when shopping for a french press is the seal of the plunger against the surrounding glass.&&” explains milos. “the fit should be just right to move up and down smoothly.&& but also not let any grounds come out around the sides and into your cup.” .&& when it comes to the carafe itself.&& milos notes that both glass and steel are better options than plastic. “glass produces a cleaner cup of coffee than see-through plastic.&& as any chemicals used in the plastic can infiltrate your coffee.” .&& we’ve rounded up some of our favorite french presses on the market to help you get your ideal cup of coffee..&& the bodum chambord french press combines style and substance. the heat- and stain-resistant borosilicate glass allows you to monitor your coffee as it steeps.&& and the three-part stainless steel plunger features a fine mesh filter that keeps coffee grounds out while extracting the aromatics that we want. the 12-ounce model is rated as making three cups of coffee (note that bodum is a european company.&& and they count four ounces as one cup)..&& the popular espro french press has a patented double micro-filter. while some of the other french presses leave sediment behind.&& this filter kept grounds out of the finished product. pressing the filter on this model completely stops the extraction process and seals the grounds away from the brewed coffee.&& which means that your coffee won’t continue to extract and develop bitterness as it sits (which is great.&& considering that the insulated carafe keeps coffee hot for hours). this dishwasher-safe 32-ounce french press is also available in polished stainless steel.&& white.&& or black..&& the kona french press combines form and function. the decorative outer shell insulates the coffee maker and protects the borosilicate glass carafe from bumps that might chip or crack it. it has a three-piece stainless steel infuser and filtration system.&& intentionally designed so that plastic never comes into contact with your coffee. the bpa-free plastic lid.&& plunger.&& and carafe are all dishwasher safe.&& and the 34-ounce carafe is microwave safe.&& in case you want to reheat your coffee..&& this veken french press has an ultra-fine filter screen to prevent stray grounds from getting into your finished coffee. the carafe is made of thickened heat-resistant borosilicate glass to withstand boiling water.&& and we love the exact scale line that this particular model offers that can help you prepare exactly the amount of coffee you’d like..&& le creuset’s french press takes the craftsmanship the brand is known for and applies it to this manual coffee maker. we like the pop of color from the cherry red model. because it’s made of stoneware.&& this coffee maker is fairly resistant to chips.&& cracks.&& scratches.&& stains.&& and odors.&& and it’s rated to go from 500 degrees fahrenheit to 0 degrees fahrenheit.&& in the oven.&& the microwave.&& the dishwasher.&& or even the freezer. the single stainless filter leaves an expected amount of sediment behind.&& and the stoneware doesn’t insulate as well as some other materials.&& so we recommend preheating this by filling it with hot water before you brew your coffee..&& the lid.&& filter.&& handle.&& and surround on this elegant 34-ounce french press are all made with 304-grade stainless steel.&& which is adept at withstanding rust and corrosion. the carafe itself is made of borosilicate glass to help keep tastes pure. the four-level filtration system comes with a lid strainer to catch stray grounds. all the parts are dishwasher safe.&& and this french press comes with a lifetime warranty..&& it’s important to use hot water.&& not boiling water.&& when making your coffee via a french press. boiling water will cause the ground beans to burn if used.][best french press coffee, according to baristas, how do you make coffee in a
