thread-like structures in your cells. they contain dna and proteins., proteins, which do most of the work in your cells. testing can look for changes in the amount and activity level of proteins. if it finds changes, it might be due to changes in your dna., find genetic diseases in unborn babies. this is one type of prenatal testing., screen newborn babies for certain treatable conditions, lower the risk of genetic diseases in embryos that were created using assisted reproductive technology, find out if you carry a gene for a certain disease that could be passed on to your children. this is called carrier testing., see whether you are at increased risk of developing a specific disease. this may be done for a disease that runs in your family., diagnose certain diseases, identify genetic changes that may be causing or contributing to a disease that you were already diagnosed with, figure out how severe a disease is, help guide your doctor in deciding the best medicine and dosage for you. this is called pharmacogenomic testing., helping doctors make recommendations for treatment or monitoring, giving you more information for making decisions about your health and your familys health: if you find out that you are at risk for a certain disease, you might take steps to lower that risk. for example, you may find out that you should be screened for a disease earlier and more often. or you might decide to make healthy lifestyle changes. if you find out that you are not at risk for a certain disease, then you can skip unnecessary checkups or screenings a test could give you

unnecessary checkups or screenings, a test could give you information that helps you make decisions about having children, identifying genetic disorders early in life so treatment can be started as soon as possible, depending on the results, you may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty. this can be especially true if you are diagnosed with a disease that does not have effective treatments., you may be worried about genetic discrimination in employment or insurance, genetic testing may give you limited information about a genetic disease. for example, it cannot tell you whether you will have symptoms, how severe a disease might be, or whether a disease will get worse over time., some genetic tests are expensive, and health insurance might only cover part of the cost. or they may not cover it at all., frequently asked questions about genetic testing (national human genome research institute) also in spanish, genetic testing (for parents) (nemours foundation) also in spanish,
