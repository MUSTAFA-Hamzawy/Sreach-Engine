[albert wan ran bleak house books.&& an independent bookstore in hong kong.&& for nearly five years.&& before closing it in late 2021. the changing political climate and crackdown on dissent within hong kong made life too uncertain for wan.&& his wife and two children. .&& as they were preparing to move.&& wan packed a box of books at risk of being purged by the government. he brought them on a plane back to the united states in january and donated them to the internet archive for preservation. .&& the collection includes books about the pro-democracy protests of 2019—some photography books; another was a limited edition book of essays by young journalists who covered the event. there was a book about the tiananmen square massacre and volumes about hong kong politics.&& culture and history—most written in chinese. .&& “in hong kong.&& because the government is restricting and policing speech in a way that is even causing libraries to remove books from shelves.&& i thought that it would be good to digitize books about hong kong that might be in danger of disappearing entirely.&&” wan said..&& “i thought that it would be good to digitize books about hong kong that might be in danger of disappearing entirely.”.&& hearing that bleak house books would be shutting its doors.&& the internet archive reached out and offered to digitize its remaining books. as it happens.&& wan said his inventory was dwindling quickly. so.&& he gathered contributions from others.&& and along with some from his own collection.&& donated about thirty books and some periodicals to the internet archive for preservation and digitization. wan said he was amazed at how flexible and open the archive was in the process.&& assisting with shipping and scanning the materials at no cost to him. (see hong kong community collection.).&& now.&& wan wants others to do the same..&& “there are still titles out there that have never been digitized and might be on the radar for being purged or sort of hidden from public view.&&” wan said. “the hope is that more people would contribute and donate those kinds of books to the archive and have them digitized so that people still have access to them.”.&& do you have books you’d like to donate to the internet archive? learn more..&& wan said he likes how the internet archive operates using controlled digital lending (cdl) where the items can be borrowed one at time.&& not infringing on the rights of the authors.&& while providing broad public access..&& before his family moved to hong kong for his wife’s university teaching job.&& wan was a civil rights and criminal defense attorney in private practice. now.&& they are all getting settled in rochester.&& new york.&& where wan plans to open another bookshop..&& many items are added to the internet archive’s collections every month.&& by us and by our patrons. here’s a round up of some of the new media you might want to check out. logging in might be required to borrow certain items. .&& this month we’ve added books on varied subjects in more than 20 languages. click through to explore.&& but here are a few interesting items to start with:.&& the audio archive contains recordings ranging from alternative news programming.&& to grateful dead concerts.&& to old time radio shows.&& to book and poetry readings.&& to original music uploaded by our users. explore..&& founded in 2005.&& librivox is a community of volunteers from all over the world who record audiobooks of public domain texts in many different languages. explore..&& listen to this collection of 78rpm records.&& cylinder recordings.&& and other recordings from the early 20th century. explore..&& the live music archive is a community committed to providing the highest quality live concerts in a lossless.&& downloadable format.&& along with the convenience of on-demand streaming (all with artist permission). explore..&& .&& this collection hosts complete.&& freely downloadable/streamable.&& often creative commons-licensed catalogs of ‘virtual record labels’. these ‘netlabels’ are non-profit.&& community-built entities dedicated to providing high quality.&& non-commercial.&& freely distributable mp3/ogg-format music for online download in a multitude of genres. explore..&& watch feature films.&& classic shorts.&& documentaries.&& propaganda.&& movie trailers.&& and more! explore..&& .&& to celebrate national library week 2022.&& we are taking readers behind the scenes to meet the librarians who work at the internet archive and in associated programs..&& alexis rossi has always loved books and connecting others with information. after receiving her undergraduate degree in english and creative writing.&& she became a book editor and then worked in online news. .&& in 2006.&& rossi joined the staff of the internet archive. she was working on the launch of the open library project when she recognized the need to learn more about how to best organize materials. she enrolled at san jose state university and earned her master’s of library and information science in 2010..&& “it gave me a better grasp of how to hierarchically organize information in a way that is sensible and useful to other libraries.&&” rossi said. “it also gave me better familiarity with how other more traditional libraries actually work—the types of data and systems they use.”.&& rossi concentrated on web interfaces for library information.&& understanding digital metadata.&& and how to operate as a digital librarian. in addition to overseeing the open library project.&& at the internet archive.&& rossi managed a revamp of the organization’s website.&& ran the wayback machine for four years.&& founded the webwide crawling program.&& and is currently a librarian and director of media & access..&& “one of the themes of my life is trying to empower people to do whatever they want to do.&&” said rossi.&& who grew up in monterey.&& california.&& and now lives in san francisco. “giving people the resources to teach themselves—whatever they want to learn—is my driving force.”.&& “giving people the resources to teach themselves—whatever they want to learn—is my driving force.”.&& rossi acknowledges she is privileged to have means to avail herself to an abundance of information.&& while many in other parts of the world do not. there are so many societal problems she cannot solve.&& rossi said.&& but she believes her work is making a contribution.  .&& “we can build a library that allows people to access information for free.&& wherever they are.&& and however they can get to it.&& in whatever way. that.&& to me.&& is incredibly important.&&” rossi said. it’s also rewarding to help patrons discover new information and recover materials they may have thought were lost.&& she added..&& when she’s not working.&& rossi enjoys making funky jewelry and elaborate cakes (a skill she learned on youtube)..&& among the millions of items and collections in the internet archive.&& what is rossi’s favorite?

in fact.&& seaberg has 1.&&729 suggestions. she has organized what she wants to read in a publicly available list on open library..&& “i’ve had a lifelong interest in reading and books.&&” said seaberg.&& who worked as an assistant in her high school library in milford.&& connecticut. it was there that a mentoring librarian helped shape her taste in reading and introduced her to the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy by douglas adams. .&& seaberg went on to earn her bachelor’s degree in library science from southern connecticut state university in 1996. she learned about the book publishing industry.&& practical skills of cataloguing.&& boolean searching.&& and managing databases. she later earned a master’s degree in digital media from quinnipiac university in connecticut..&& in 2017.&& seaberg began to volunteer with open library and was hired to join the internet archive staff in 2020 to work for patron services. based in amsterdam.&& she responds to email requests to connect users with resources and helps coordinate a team of more than 200 volunteers to fix metadata issues. seaberg works to maintain the digital collection.&& identify duplicates.&& and make sure the record represents the available books. she also fulfills interlibrary loan requests.&& as part of the internet archive’s new ill service..&& “it’s rewarding to make something discoverable.”.&& prior joining the internet archive.&& seaberg worked at gateway computers in the late 90s where she gained useful technology experience. she later worked in communications for a hospital.&& managing its website. those positions provided her with a sense of information architecture.&& she said.&& that she has applied to her work at the internet archive..&& seaberg said she is fascinated by everything that the internet archive provides to the public. in her job.&& she enjoys working with the book metadata. “it’s rewarding to make something discoverable.&&” she said. if people have an author they like.&& seaberg tries to make sure there are subject headings and tags to make it easier for them to find related materials of interest. .&& recently.&& seaberg said.&& it’s been meaningful to be involved in efforts to provide access to books being challenged by local school districts because of controversial content. she’s helped assemble digital collections of titles being targeted to ensure continuous access should an entity decide to ban them. .&& when seaberg is not working.&& she loves to play board games—gravitating to hobbyist.&& european games such as the gaia project.&& the complex.&& economy-building game that takes place in space. her other main hobby is book hunting at charity shops and openbare boekenkastjes (free libraries) in and around her home in amsterdam. since seaberg has limited shelf space.&& she sticks to her rule of only buying books that are on her open library want to read list.  .&& among her favorite projects when it comes to the internet archive collection: organizing the profiles of individual authors to make sure their works are all consolidated and easy to find for patrons. .&& many items are added to the internet archive’s collections every month.&& by us and by our patrons. here’s a round up of some of the new media you might want to check out. logging in might be required to borrow certain items. .&& this month we’ve added books on varied subjects in more than 20 languages. click through to explore.&& but here are a few interesting items to start with:.&& the audio archive contains recordings ranging from alternative news programming.&& to grateful dead concerts.&& to old time radio shows.&& to book and poetry readings.&& to original music uploaded by our users. explore..&& founded in 2005.&& librivox is a community of volunteers from all over the world who record audiobooks of public domain texts in many different languages. explore..&& listen to this collection of 78rpm records.&& cylinder recordings.&& and other recordings from the early 20th century. explore..&& culbertson sasha – aeolian vocalion d 02143 1923.&& the live music archive is a community committed to providing the highest quality live concerts in a lossless.&& downloadable format.&& along with the convenience of on-demand streaming (all with artist permission). explore..&& .&& this collection hosts complete.&& freely downloadable/streamable.&& often creative commons-licensed catalogs of ‘virtual record labels’. these ‘netlabels’ are non-profit.&& community-built entities dedicated to providing high quality.&& non-commercial.&& freely distributable mp3/ogg-format music for online download in a multitude of genres. explore..&& watch feature films.&& classic shorts.&& documentaries.&& propaganda.&& movie trailers.&& and more! explore..&& .&& here are some of the notable new additions to the internet archive from february 2022.

publisher of 11:11 press says it sells—rather than licenses—books to libraries for online lending to reach a broad audience..&& the goal of 11:11 press is to have its books in every library in the

independent press based in minneapolis sells its books at a discount to nonprofits. “from a publishing standpoint.&& our authors care about being read so we want to get our books to as many people as possible.”.&& the internet archive recently bought the entire catalog of books from 11:11 press and made them available online for controlled digital lending to one person at a time.  .&& “honestly.&& i don’t know why anyone would not want to have their books in a library.&& especially the internet archive.&& which is more relevant now than it has been any other time.&&” wilt said. “it used to be the library of the future. but in our era of remote learning and people working from home.&& the internet archive is the library of the present. you don’t have to go into an actual physical building. it’s available for anyone with an internet connection. it’s probably the most relevant lending institution at the moment.”.&& “[internet archive] used to be the library of the future. but in our era of remote learning and people working from home.&& the internet archive is the library of the present.”.&& in business for four years.&& 11:11 press publishes an eclectic mix of titles that wilt describes as “disruptive literature.” its authors push the boundaries. some books have a very heavy.&& theoretical and academic focus while others are about everyday working people. there are books of poetry.&& short stories.&& novels.&& and hybrid work. the aim is to give exposure to underrepresented voices and offer an alternative from what is produced by mainstream publishers..&& “we’re kind of this lighthouse trying to find those people who are actively looking for something that’s new and exciting.&&” said wilt..&& in one of the 11:11 press “theory fiction” titles.&& zer000 excess.&& images are “glitching out” within the text.&& leading the reader to consider what meaning is being created. jake reber wrote the book using microsoft powerpoint 2007 – the only version of the software with identifiable software features known to produce these “glitches.” authors like reber intentionally use these embedded software tools incorrectly in order to get distortion. “like the early punk bands who put fuzz in their music.&& we’re trying to add that distortion in the work.&&” said wilt..&& human tetris merges digital dating in an all-too-honest newspaper style of queer dating profiles. it was written as a collaboration between two different voices building a lattice of interlocking online identities by vi khi nao and ali raz..&& the publisher features “dangerous writing.&&” which uses fiction as the buffer to draw on personal experience. for authors in this genre.&& fiction is the lie that tells the truth. “we want to encourage writers to go to those uncharted territories of the self. what you find might be hard to look at.&& but if you pull back the layers.&& there’s something unique and beautiful there.” wilt said..&& jinnwoo (ben webb) is a writer.&& musician.&& visual artist.&& and author of the book little hollywood published by 11:11 press. it consists of b-grade movie scripts with paper doll cut outs. the idea is to engage the reader by having them cut out the dolls and use the scripts. “going to those dark places with honesty encourages the reader to be more mindful.&& more present.&& which  leads to more empathy.&&” wilt said..&& did you know? thanks to the innovative partnership between the internet archive and better world books—our favorite online bookstore—patrons who browse to the 11:11 press books at archive.org have a direct link to purchase new copies of the books in print via better world books..&& in its next catalog.&& 11:11 press will be coming out with a 520-page illustrated old testament and corresponding painting. this 9-by-12-inch book.&& which will sell for $150.&& is too religious for some and too secular for others.&& making it a perfect product for a small press.&& wilt said. another upcoming book will be a compilation of short stories by the late peter christopher who helped start the dangerous writing movement..&& as a small press.&& wilt said the focus isn’t to write with marketing in mind but rather for authors to write the stories only they can tell. the hope is for 11:11 press to create something greater to help benefit society and get people to think in a different way. “reading authors who courageously face their lives.&& their past.&& their future.&& encourages us.&& the readers.&& to do the same.&&” he said..&& wilt said he anticipates other independent publishers will follow suit in selling their works to the internet archive. “small presses drive innovation. this is where experimentation occurs.&&” he said. “our top priority is sharing knowledge.”.&& many items are added to the
