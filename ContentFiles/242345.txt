[reviews.&& senior editor at encyclopaedia britannica reviews.&& plants are a wonderful addition to any home. they liven up a space.&& and studies have shown that they can even make you feel happier and less stressed. but what if you’re a tad irresponsible when it comes to remembering to water them? if you have trouble keeping plants alive.&& the problem might not be that you’re cursed. you could just be working with finicky plants. beginners should try starting with tougher houseplants to gain confidence and skills (yes.&& remembering to water a plant is a skill). .&& what should you consider before buying a new houseplant?.&& the main cause of death in plants is usually under or over-watering. you can tell when a plant is thirsty because it’ll wilt. on the other hand.&& a drowning plant will likely suffer from root rot and have soggy.&& squishy roots and stems. if you’re looking for a plant that you can forget about.&& succulents are the way to go. if you have a tendency to drown your plants.&& consider a tropical plant that needs more attention. putting water-storing crystals in your soil might also help with either problem because they’ll absorb and release water when the plants need it.   .&& if you don’t want to experience the nightmare of root rot.&& you need a drainage system. otherwise.&& the water will pool and your plants’ roots will get gross and squishy. classic terra-cotta pots are usually the way to go.&& because there’s a hole.&& and the material naturally absorbs excess water. if you’re set on a hanging plant or a cute planter.&& you can create your own drainage system. typically.&& i like to put pebbles and charcoal on the bottom of the pot and then some mesh to separate the plant from the excess water. of course.&& this could potentially cause mold.&& so i repeat: get a pot with a drainage hole! .&& when you research plant care.&& resources will normally tell you whether direct.&& bright indirect.&& medium.&& or low light is appropriate. direct light means placing your plant directly in front of a south-facing window. you can check this graphic for more details. .&& it’s hard to pinpoint the perfect plant for each person.&& but here are some plants that have a reputation for being tough cookies..&& pothos.&& or devil’s ivy.&& is a fan favorite thanks to the beautiful tendency to vine out and climb your furniture. i’ve had pothos for years.&& and i’m always shocked at their stubborn refusal to die.&& even when the odds are stacked against them. they are by far the hardiest plants i’ve ever cared for. an anecdote if you’re skeptical: i once tried to create a closed terrarium and filled it with moss and various plants. everything died in about a month—except the single pothos stem. the terrarium has been untouched and left in a shady corner for about a year.&& and the pothos is still kicking..&& heart-shaped philodendrons are very similar in appearance to the pothos.&& but they have thinner.&& more heart-shaped leaves and more aerial roots per node. it’s best to not get too hung up on specific plant names because sometimes even the plant store will get it wrong. for example.&& my “silver philodendron” is actually a scindapsus pictus. in any event.&& these plants are just as easy to care for as devil’s ivy.&& so it comes down to your preference..&& i wish i could relive the delighted shock i felt the first time i saw one of these gravity-defying plants! on top of being very cool (hello.&& they’re nicknamed ufo plants).&& pilea are also fairly easy to care for. they require medium light (although i’ve seen them really flourish in direct light) and don’t require a lot of water (just fully soak whenever the soil is completely dry). best of all.&& some people call these the friendship plant because they grow little babies that can be removed.&& repotted.&& and gifted. that’s right.&& it basically pays for itself because it’ll cover all your gift-giving needs. in my experience.&& even if i really screw up caring for one.&& there’s usually a baby that will grow from its parent’s dead stump. my only complaint is that you do have to rotate the plant often or else it will start craning towards the sun and eventually slump over..&& the snake plant is the most classic recommendation for people lacking a green thumb. these low-maintenance plants require little water or attention.&& so you don’t have to panic if you forget to water them now and then. personally.&& i find them a little boring.&& but it’s a great starter plant for someone looking to build confidence..&& the zz plant is great for people who tend to forget they have a plant. its rhizomes (horizontal underground stems) store moisture so they can go relatively long stints without water. they can also tolerate low light.&& which is ideal for anyone working with limited sunlight or crowded windowsills. similar to the other plants on this list.&& it can tolerate dry air.&& doesn’t need fancy potting mix.&& and accepts regular ol’ tap water..&& like the beloved kitchen pan.&& the cast-iron plant is built to last. it can live in hardiness zones up to 10.&& meaning you can also grow these outside.&& even if you’re living somewhere with a less-than-forgiving climate. for inside growing.&& a simple potting mix and a terra-cotta pot (a drainage hole is a must) will suffice. it can survive in partial shade and won’t mind if you forget to water it now and then..&& i used to have one of these magical-looking cacti on my desk at work. i placed it by the window and watered it *maybe* once every three months. otherwise.&& i never thought about it. i never even took it out of its original plastic pot. despite my neglect.&& it lived for many years.&& happy as a clam (or perhaps in deep dormancy)..&& the haworthiopsis fasciata.&& aka the zebra cactus.&& is a common plant for children and total plant newbies. the spiny succulent tends to be slow-growing and enjoys dry climates. you only need to water it occasionally.&& letting the soil completely dry out between waterings.][the best houseplants for plant killers, how often do you want to water this plant? , do i
