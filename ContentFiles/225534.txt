combinatorial optimization problems are pervasive across science and industry. modern deep learning tools are poised to solve these problems at unprecedented scales, but a unifying framework that incorporates insights from statistical physics is still outstanding. here we demonstrate how graph neural networks can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. our approach is broadly applicable to quantum technologies, general parameter-shift rules for quantum gradients david wierichs, josh izaac, cody wang, cedric yen-yu lin 2022 variational quantum algorithms are ubiquitous in applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. due to the structure of conventional parametrized quantum gates, the evaluated functions typically are finite fourier series of the input parameters. in this work, we use this fact to derive new, general parameter-shift rules for single-parameter gates, and provide closed-form expressions to apply quantum technologies, foundations for learning from noisy quantum experiments hsin-yuan (robert) huang, steven t. flammia, john preskill qip 2022 2022 we study our ability to learn physical operations in quantum systems where all operations, from state preparation, dynamics, to measurement, are a priori unknown. we prove that without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state space by composing the operations, then every operation could be learned up to an arbitrarily small error. when one cannot explore the full space but the operations related: bringing practical applications of quantum computing closer quantum technologies, open quantum assembly language andrew cross, ali javadi-abhari, thomas alexander, lev bishop, colm a. ryan, steven heidel, niel de beaudrap, john smolin, jay m. gambetta, blake r. johnson 2022 open quantum assembly language (openqasm 2) [1] was proposed as an imperative programming language for quantum computation based on earlier qasm dialects [2–6]. openqasm is one of the programming interfaces of the ibm quantum services [7]. in the period since openqasm 2 was introduced, it has become something of a de facto standard, allowing a number of independent tools to inter-operate using openqasm quantum technologies, engineering fast bias-preserving gates on stabilized cat qubits qian xu, joseph iverson, fernando brandão, liang jiang 2022 stabilized cat codes can provide a biased noise channel with a set of bias-preserving (bp) gates, which can significantly reduce the resource overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computing. all existing schemes of bp gates, however, require adiabatic quantum evolution, with performance limited by excitation loss and nonadiabatic errors during the adiabatic gates. in this paper, we apply a
