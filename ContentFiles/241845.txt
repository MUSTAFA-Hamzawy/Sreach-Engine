[reviews.&& contributor.&& if you ask patrick curran.&& executive chef of the lore group in washington.&& d.c..&& why your baked goods never turn out quite as tasty as those from your neighborhood patisserie.&& you’ll probably like the answer. it turns out.&& your skills (or lack thereof) are not to blame! you can instead point the finger at your oven. if it’s not a convection oven.&& it simply won’t measure up to the equipment used professionally. .&& “any restaurant you go to today has a convection oven.&&” says curran. “most conventional (non-convection) ovens have a heating element on top and on bottom.&& but there’s no way to actually move the hot air around.&&” he explains. as a result.&& despite your best intentions.&& you’ll always have a hot spot (and relatedly.&& a cool spot or two) in your oven.&& which leads to uneven cooking. “convection ovens add a fan to the equation.&&” curran notes. “instead of having all the hot air stay on bottom or top.&& it gets circulated throughout.&& which means you’re cooking more evenly.” .&& while curran admits that it’s taken some time for convection ovens to catch on.&& he’s sure that almost all your cooking would benefit from this appliance. “anything you’re baking is going to come out infinitely better in a convection oven rather than a regular oven.&&” he says. while you may need to monitor and adjust cook times when you first make the switch (convection ovens will often cook faster than regular ovens) this adjustment period is worth it. “anything that you’re trying to get caramelization or color on should be cooked in a convection oven.&&” curran continues. “whether you’re reverse-searing steaks.&& making a holiday roast.&& or cooking any protein with a fat cap.&& you’ll be able to get a deeper browning and deeper flavor with a convection oven.” .&& to help you choose the best convection oven for your needs.&& we’ve rounded up some of the best below. .&& the breville countertop convection oven is one of the best-performing options we’ve come across. the element iq system helps identify where your ingredients need the most heat to ensure more even.&& rapid cooking and then uses its built-in fan to adjust as needed. we love that the oven comes with nine cooking functions.&& including toast.&& bagel.&& pizza.&& cookies.&& and broil. the interior is quite roomy and can hold a six-cup muffin tray or a 13-inch pizza with ease..&& if you’re looking for a larger countertop convection oven.&& this oster extra large model lives up to its name. we appreciated its generous measurements of 19.29 x 21.65 x 12.91 inches.&& which allowed us to bake two pizzas or an impressive loaf and a half of bread (sliced) at once. this oven is easy to use.&& with straightforward buttons that control the setting.&& time.&& and temperature. the temperature ranges from 200 to 450 degrees and the 90-minute timer with an auto-off function ensures that you’re not overcooking accidentally..&& for folks who prefer knobs.&& this is certainly the model for you. the wolf gourmet countertop convection oven comes with interior lighting.&& exacting temperature control.&& and of course.&& the fan for convection heating.&& all wrapped in a compact device. heated air is constantly circulated throughout this oven.&& which we found resulted in extremely even roasting.&& broiling.&& baking.&& and toasting without uneven burns. we also loved the precision temperature probe that allows you to control the exact doneness of your proteins. plus.&& thanks to the “stay on” feature.&& you can keep this oven running for up to four hours.&& which means slow-roasting is well within your grasp..&& this roomy cuisinart convection oven can fit a 13-inch pizza or a 9 x 13-inch baking pan.&& and it features 15 cooking functions.&& including our favorite: speed convection. this mode takes convection cooking to a new level.&& resulting in evenly cooked baked (or roasted) goods in even less time by eliminating the need to preheat. plus.&& this machine comes with a 13-inch pizza stone to help you get the perfect crust..&& as you might have heard.&& convection ovens and air fryers work in essentially the same fashion.&& except air fryers concentrate a high amount of heat in a smaller area to achieve that coveted crispiness. given the two appliances’ similarities.&& it comes as little surprise that some models combine these functions into a single countertop device. we love this option from cuisinart.&& which lets you air fry and convection bake.&& among other cooking techniques like toasting and defrosting. we fried 2.5 pounds of fries with ease (you can go up to three pounds).&& and we were also able to bake a 12-inch pizza without skipping a beat. plus.&& the relatively compact footprint makes it a winner in smaller kitchens..&& when baking with a convection oven.&& lower the recipe’s temperature by 25 degrees fahrenheit.][why convection ovens are the best, our picks, breville
