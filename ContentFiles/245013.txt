[.&& whether you’re writing just for fun.&& for school.&& or with professional goals in mind.&& these exercises can all help you to improve your writing. some will give you inspiration.&& others will help you avoid editing as you write.&& and many of them will help you pay closer attention to your word choices..&& i hope you’ll enjoy giving them a go!.&& if you find yourself doing more editing than actual writing.&& then try covering up (or.&& on a laptop.&& turning down) your screen while you draft..&& if.&& like me.&& you can touch-type – try closing your eyes instead. i find it surprisingly relaxing! (though i tend to stop every sentence or two to make sure i’ve hit the keys i thought i was hitting…).&& at first.&& it might seem odd not to be able to see the words that you’re typing – but you might well find that you write faster and express your thoughts more freely this way..&& writing.&& as most other crafts.&& only gets better with practice. if you want to improve.&& therefore.&& you will need to write pretty much every single day..&& the best strategy to achieve this objective is to set a goal of how many words you want to write per day.&& and then to track your progress over time. a simple notebook or spreadsheet should be enough for you to record your daily statistics..&& the prolifiko blog has a great piece with more tips to set writing goals and resolutions and to make sure you achieve them..&& if you want to write.&& but you don’t know what you want to write.&& try using a writing prompt. this could be anything from a story scenario (“write about someone who gets caught in a lie”) to a blog post title (“ten things i wish i could tell my 15-year-old self”)..&& here are a couple of sources of prompts to keep you busy for a while:.&& 25 creative writing prompts.&& a list of prompts you can use to start writing a simple story or even a novel..&& 365 creative writing prompts.&& from think written – a mixed bag of prompts.&& with some for stories and some for poems; many would also work for blogging..&& even if you’re working on a longer piece.&& like a novel.&& prompts can be helpful. a line of dialogue.&& for instance.&& might give you just the inspiration you need for your next scene..&& there’s no writing rule that says you need to begin at the beginning. in fact.&& many writers find it more effective to start at the end..&& you can do this in a couple of different ways:.&& choose a famous masterpiece or classic novel (like jane austen’s pride and prejudice or shakespeare’s romeo and juliet) and write your own version..&& this is a great exercise because you can do it at almost any level: you could write a short story for children.&& or you could write a whole novel or screenplay. (bridget jones’s diary.&& for instance.&& borrowed heavily from pride and prejudice; the children’s movie gnomeo and juliet is based.&& as you might guess.&& on romeo and juliet.).&& you can do this with fairytales.&& too.&& like the story of cinderella or little red riding hood. you might decide to bring the stories into the modern world – or you might switch to a completely different genre.&& like a western version of little red riding hood or a sci-fi version of cinderella..&& hopefully.&& you’ll think of some interesting ways to present an old story in a new way – great practice for avoiding clichés and stereotypes in your own writing..&& a “found poem” is one created from text that already exists – and some writers enjoy repurposing spam emails for this!.&& check your spam folder. i’m sure that.&& like mine.&& it’s full of emails with some strange wording and dubious promises like:.&& i did not need to find a winning product. he gave it to me….&& just drinking 1 cup of this delicious hot beverage in the morning sets you up to burn more fat than 45 exhausting minutes on the treadmill..&& hello %e-mail_address%.&& i know your very love engineer jobs and want have t-shirt for engineer jobs..&& it is vital to have a telephone system that has all the specific functions.&& (all of these are taken verbatim from my own spam folder…).&& could you pick out a few lines (they don’t have to be consecutive ones) to create your own found poem? feel free to add some words if needed. there are some wonderfully odd examples here..&& inspiration can come in all sorts of ways – but if you’re struggling to find an idea.&& try turning to other people’s creative works. in my blogging.&& i’ve often been inspired by other people’s post structures.&& by an idea of theirs that i want to take further – or even by something they’ve written that i disagree with..&& you can use music and art in a similar way: they can be particularly potent sources of ideas for stories. if you have a favourite song or artist.&& what in their work speaks to you? how could you craft a story using some of those themes or thoughts? alternatively.&& look through some photos of artworks.&& and choose one or more to use as the basis for a story..&& this is a fun exercise that a lot of writers use to dig into who their characters are: the character interview. you can work through a pre-set list of questions.&& or you can come up with your own in advance.&& or you can just start typing and go with the flow!.&& you might do this essentially like a character questionnaire or checklist.&& or you might want to write it more like a mini-story.&& with you as the author inviting your character to sit down and talk..&& depending on the sort of fiction you write.&& the setting for your interview could be almost anything – perhaps you’re enjoying a casual chat over coffee and cake with your character.&& or maybe you’re interviewing them as a journalist.&& or even in court. or.&& if you’re into rather darker fiction.&& you might be conducting an interrogation….&& however you do this.&& it’s a great exercise to have fun with.&& and you might discover a whole backstory to your character that you’d never thought about before..&& this is a fun exercise that can work for almost any type of writing: craft a piece where each sentence starts with the next letter of the alphabet. here’s the start of one to show you what i mean:.&& at six o’clock.&& josie woke up. before she’d even opened her eyes.&& she knew what had woken her: she could hear it.&& just like she’d heard it every friday morning for months. cliff.&& her neighbour.&& was out in his garden. despite all the times she’d gone round and asked him.&& through gritted teeth.&& to please wait until at least seven.&& he was mowing the blasted lawn again..&& “excuse me!” she called.&& over the fence. for a moment.&& she thought he hadn’t heard her over the sound of the mower..&& (yes.&& it’s tricky once you get to x! you might find this list helpful.&& or you might choose to use a sentence-starting word that merely contains an x.).&& can you limit every sentence you write to ten words? (or fewer!) this might be tricky. it’s a great exercise for bloggers and online marketers.&& though. short snappy sentences and paragraphs work well online..&& you might want to draft as normal.&& then edit ruthlessly. or you could count the words as you type. whatever works for you!.&& (yes.&& the sentences in this section are ten words max…).&& this is a common exercise advised for fiction writers: write a whole scene without using a single adverb..&& adverbs are words that modify verbs.&& adjectives and adverbs. they often (though not always) end with –ly..&& here are a few sentences with the adverbs indicated in bold:.&& the girl walked quickly to school. (“quickly” is modifying the verb “walked”.).&& slowly.&& the fairly tall man stood.  (“slowly” is modifying the verb “stood”.&& and “fairly” is modifying the adjective “tall”).&& on the bus.&& the baby cried dismayingly loudly. (“dismayingly” is modifying the adverb “loudly”.&& and “loudly” is modifying the verb “cried”.).&& writing without adverbs forces you to write crisper.&& clearer (and shorter!) sentences.&& which often have more impact. in particular.&& you’ll find yourself choosing stronger verbs..&& all of these sentences could replace “the girl walked quickly to school” – and each has a slightly different nuance:.&& of course.&& adverbs aren’t bad in themselves – so i don’t recommend avoiding them in all your writing! this exercise can help you.&& though.&& to be more aware of when you’re using adverbs unnecessarily..&& —.&& pick one of the above exercises to try out during your writing time this week.
