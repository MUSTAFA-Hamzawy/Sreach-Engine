[.&& is rhetorician on your resume? it should be.&& because i’d be surprised if you haven’t employed one or more of the methods listed below for conveying emphasis to your writing..&& rhetoric.&& the art of persuasive written or spoken discourse.&& was developed in ancient greece.&& and every one of the terms below stems from classical greek or from latin.&& the language of the culture that inherited the greek oratory legacy. but that should be no obstacle to adding these tried-and-true tools to your argumentative armamentarium.&& because brief definitions.&& as well as examples.&& accompany this exhaustive but by no means complete list:.&& 1. amplification an expansion of detail to clarify a point: “we few.&& we happy few.&& we band of brothers.”.&& 2. anacoluthon a sudden break in a sentence’s grammatical structure: “so.&& then i pulled up to her house — are you still with me here?”.&& 3. anadiplosis repetition of words.&& especially located at the end of one phrase or clause and the beginning of the next: “i was at a loss for words.&& words that perhaps would have gotten me into even more trouble.”.&& 4. anaphora repetition of one or more words at the head of consecutive phrases.&& clauses.&& or sentences: “i came.&& i saw.&& i conquered.”.&& 5. anastrophe inversion of word order to mark emphasis: “enter the forest primeval.”.&& 6. antanaclasis repetition of a word in a sentence in which a different meaning is applied each time: “if you aren’t fired with enthusiasm.&& you will be fired.&& with enthusiasm.”.&& 7. antanagoge the contradiction of a negative comment with a positive one.&& as in “the car wouldn’t start this time.&& but it least it didn’t catch on fire.”.&& 8. antimetabole reversal of repeated words or phrases for effect: “ask not what your country can do for you.&& but what you can do for your country..&& 9. antiphrasis ironic use of a single word: “it was a cool 100 degrees in the shade.”.&& .&& 10. antistrophe repetition of a word or phrase at the close of successive clauses: “you said he was late — true enough. you said he was not prepared — true enough. you said he did not defend his statements — true enough.”.&& 11. antithesis contrast within parallel phrases (not to be confused with the ordinary use of the word to mean “extreme opposite”): “many are called.&& but few are chosen.” the term can also refer to literary characters who.&& though not necessarily antagonists.&& represent opposite personal characteristics or moral views..&& 12. apophasis calling attention to something by dismissing it: “no one would suggest that those who are homeless elected to live on the streets willingly.”.&& 13. aporia a statement of hesitation.&& also known as dubitatio.&& in which characters express to themselves an actual or feigned doubt or dilemma: “should i strike now.&& or bide my time?”.&& 14. aposiopesis abrupt discontinuation of a statement: “if you say that one more time.&& i’m gonna –”.&& 15. apostrophe interruption of thought to directly address a person or a personification: “so.&& i ask you.&& dear reader.&& what would you have me do?”.&& 16. asyndeton absence of conjunctions: “we cannot dedicate.&& we cannot consecrate.&& we cannot hallow this ground.”.&& 17. auxesis exaggeration.&& often with sequential enhancement: “you found my purse? you are a hero.&& a prince.&& a god!”.&& 18. bdelygmia a rant of abusive language: “calling you an idiot would be an insult to stupid people. are you always this stupid.&& or are you just making a special effort today?”.&& 19. bomphiologia excessive braggadocio: “i am the very model of a modern major-general. i’ve information vegetable.&& animal.&& and mineral.” also known as verborum bombus..&& 20. brachyology an abbreviated expression or telegrammatic statement: “‘morning.&&’ he mumbled as he stumbled out of bed”; “i have three words for you.&& buddy: pot.&& kettle.&& black.”.&& 21. cacophony deliberate use of harsh letter sounds: “the clash and clang of steel jarred him awake.”.&& 22. catachresis a hyperbolic metaphor.&& as in “each word was a lightning bolt to his heart.”.&& 23. chiasmus this is the reversal of grammatical order from one phrase to the next.&& exemplified in these two well-known quotes about evaluation: “judge not.&& lest ye be judged” and “a heart is not judged by how much you love.&& but by how much you are loved by others.”.&& 24. commoratio repetition of a point with different wording: “he’s passed on! this parrot is no more! he has ceased to be! he’s expired and gone to meet his maker!” (etc..&& ad absurdum).&& 25. dehortatio imperative advice about how not to act: “do not look a gift horse in the mouth.”.&& 26. diacope repetition of one or more words after the interval of one or more other words: “people who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.”.&& 27. diatyposis advice: “do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”.&& 28. distinctio a definition or clarification of a term: “what we will be seeking . . . will be large.&& stable communities of like-minded people.&& which is to say relatives.”.&& 29. epanelepsis starting and ending a phrase.&& clause.&& or a sentence.&& or a passage.&& with the same word or phrase: “nothing is worse than doing nothing.”.&& 30. epistrophe the repetition of a word at the end of each phrase or clause: “i swear to tell the truth.&& the whole truth.&& and nothing but the truth.”.&& 31. epizeuxis epizeuxis.&& epizeuxis.&& epizeuxis! my favorite new word.&& also called palilogia.&& refers to nothing more than the repetition of words: “to my fifteen-year-old daughter.&& everything is ‘boring.&& boring.&& boring!’”.&& 32. hendiadys a conjunctive rather than a coordinate phrase: “i made it nice and hot.&& just the way you like it.”.&& 33. hyperbaton excursion from natural word order in various ways: “theirs was a glory unsurpassed”; “it is a sad story but true.”.&& 34. hysteron-proteron a reversal of logical order of elements in a phrase: “sudden thunder and lightning drove them to shelter.”.&& 35. litotes this is the strategy of understatement often employed to provide subtle emphasis.&& frequently for ironic effect or to underline a passionate opinion: “the assassin was not unacquainted with danger.”.&& 36. meiosis a dismissive epithet.&& such as treehugger.&& or a humorously dismissive understatement (also known as tapinosis).&& such as the monty python and the holy grail gem “it’s just a flesh wound!”.&& 37. metanoia the qualification of a statement to either diminish or strengthen its tone.&& as in “she was disturbed — make that appalled — by the spectacle.” traditionally.&& nay is often a keyword that sets up the shift.&& but no replaces it in modern usage except in facetious or whimsical writing: “you are the fairest flower in the garden — nay.&& in the entire meadow.”.&& 38. paronomasia punning wordplay.&& including any of many types.&& including homophonic or homographic puns.&& both of which are included in this example: “you can tune a guitar.&& but you can’t tuna fish. unless of course.&& you play bass.”.&& 39. pleonasm redundancy for emphasis: “we heard it with our own ears.”.&& 40. polyptoton repetition of two or more forms of a word; also known as paregmenon: “you try to forget.&& and in the forgetting.&& you are yourself forgotten.”.&& 41. polysyndeton insertion of conjunctions before each word in a list: “my fellow students read and studied and wrote and passed. i laughed and played and talked and failed.”.&& 42. scesis onomaton repetition of an idea using synonymous words or phrases: “we succeeded.&& won.&& and walked away victorious.”.&& 43. sententia the punctuation of a point with an aphorism such as “don’t judge a book by its cover.”.&& 44. sentential adverbs these single words or brief phrases emphasize the thought they precede.&& interrupt.&& or — rarely — follow. examples include however.&& naturally.&& no doubt.&& and of course — and.&& in informal writing.&& phrases such as “you see.”.&& 45. syllepsis divergent use of a word in two phrases: “we must all hang together or assuredly we will all hang separately.”.&& 46. symploce a combination of anaphora and epistrophe: “to think clearly and rationally should be a major goal for man; but to think clearly and rationally is always the greatest difficulty faced by man.”.&& 47. synathroesmus a series of adjectives.&& also known as accumulatio.&& compiled often in the service of criticism: “you’re the most arrogant.&& selfish.&& self-absorbed.&& insufferable narcissist i’ve ever met!”.&& 48. synecdoche substitution of a part or a substance for a whole.&& one thing for another.&& or a specific name used for a generic: “a hundred head of cattle were scattered throughout the field”; “a regiment of horse paraded by”; “the swordsmen unsheathed their steel”; “do you have a kleenex?”.&& 49. tapinosis invective: “get out of my way.&& you mouth-breathing cretin.”.&& 50. tricolon a series of three parallel words.&& phrases.&& clauses.&& or statements: “tell me and i forget. teach me and i remember. involve me and i learn.”.&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day? get a subscription and start receiving our writing tips and exercises daily!.&& thank you for providing a great list!.&& wow…staggering…i can’t even pronounce most of those words. still.&& a noble effort and great list.&& especially for trivia-minded folks (yes.&& if they like that sort of thing.&& this would be the sort of thing they’d like lol). thanks!.&& what a great job you’ve done.&& mark. thank you..&& examples of litotes: “not bad!”; “not unhappy”.&& resorting to litotes.&& eric remarked that pam was no small potatoes in the firm.&& to which i replied.&& “i know.&& she’s the big enchilada here.”.&& merriam-websters’s 365 mew words calendar – wednesday 7.&& july 2004 – i had to dig this up because i remember seeing “litotes.”.&& why are there no big potatoes or small enchiladas?.&& thanks for more work. not only do i have fifty new words to learn.&& thus sounding even more foreign.&& strange and obscure to folks on my daily city bus ride.&& i have to learn how to apply them….. ahhhh!.&& truly i was hoping not to be entertained by meeting and knowing these fine gems until my later days on this rock. alas.&& my dream ends with the strokes of your keyboard..&& so mark!
