kampanakis, michael kallitsis the 6th international symposium on cyber security, cryptology and machine learning (cscml 2022) 2022 traditionally, the most data-heavy part of a (d)tls handshake has been authentication which includes a handshake signature and digital certificates. although most common (d)tls usecases are not significantly affected, some constrained ones such as low bandwidth environments or delay sensitive applications can see drastic performance degradation due to big certificates or certificate chains. that has led security, privacy, and abuse prevention, learnings from federated learning in the real world christophe dupuy, tanya g. roosta, leo long, clement chung, rahul gupta, salman avestimehr icassp 2022 2022 federated learning (fl) applied to real world data may suffer from several idiosyncrasies. one such idiosyncrasy is the data distribution across devices. data across devices could be distributed such that there are some “heavy devices” with large amounts of data while there are many “light users” with only a handful of data points. there also exists heterogeneity of data across devices. in this study, we conversational ai / natural-language

web services to develop critical components of their access management, storage, and cryptography infrastructures. the dafny toolchain provides a verifer that can prove an implementation of a method satisfies its specification. when the underlying smt solver cannot establish a proof, it generates a counterexample. these counterexamples are automated reasoning, canary extraction in natural language understanding models rahil parikh, christophe dupuy, rahul gupta acl 2022 2022 natural language understanding (nlu) models can be trained on sensitive information such as phone numbers, zip-codes etc. recent literature has focused on model inversion attacks (modiva) that can extract training data from model parameters. in this work, we present a version of such an attack by

have been introduced to measure fairness in various natural language processing tasks. these metrics can be roughly categorized into two categories: 1) extrinsic metrics for evaluating fairness in downstream applications and 2) intrinsic metrics for estimating fairness in upstream contextualized language representation models. in this paper, we conduct an extensive correlation study
