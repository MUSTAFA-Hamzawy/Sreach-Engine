[, perl is a general purpose, high level interpreted and dynamic programming language. perl supports both the procedural and object-oriented programming. perl is a lot similar to c syntactically and is easy for the users who have knowledge of c, c++. since perl is a lot similar to other widely used languages syntactically, it is easier to code and learn in perl. programs can be written in perl in any of the widely used text editors like notepad++, gedit, etc., basics, fundamentals, input and output, control flow, datatypes, strings, object oriented programming in perl, subroutines, regular expressions, file handling, context sensitivity, cgi programming, misc,  , , , , , , , , , , , ,                          , writing code in comment? please use ide.geeksforgeeks.org, generate link and
