[psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes plaques.&& which are itchy or sore patches of thick.&& dry.&& discolored skin..&& while any part of your body can be affected.&& psoriasis plaques most often develop on the elbows.&& knees.&& scalp.&& back.&& face.&& palms.&& and feet..&& like other autoinflammatory diseases.&& psoriasis occurs when your immune system — which normally attacks infectious germs — begins to attack healthy cells instead..&& psoriasis plaques can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. the disease’s symptoms and appearance vary according to the type and severity of psoriasis..&& some common signs and symptoms include:.&& learn more about psoriasis symptoms.&& psoriasis.&& in general.&& is a genetic condition passed down through families. its likely that multiple genes need to be affected to allow psoriasis to occur and that its frequently triggered by an external event.&& such as an infection.&& says james w. swan.&& md.&& professor of dermatology at the loyola university stritch school of medicine in maywood.&& illinois..&& certain risk factors.&& such as a family history or being obese.&& may increase your odds of developing psoriasis..&& according to the national psoriasis foundation (npf).&& at least 10 percent of people inherit genes that could lead to psoriasis.&& but only 3 percent or less actually develop the disease. (2) for this reason.&& it is believed that the disease is caused by a combination of genetics and external factors or triggers..&& a psoriasis outbreak may be provoked by:.&& stress is a major trigger for some people with psoriasis.&& either causing psoriasis to flare up for the first time or to make it worse after you’ve been diagnosed. (3).&& psoriasis is very stress-dependent. it flares very easily when patients are under stress.&& and it tends to improve when theyre relaxed.&& says vesna petronic-rosic.&& md.&& a dermatologist and associate professor of medicine at the university of chicago medicine in illinois. stress management techniques.&& such as exercise.&& yoga.&& and meditation.&& may help manage psoriasis symptoms..&& a trip to the caribbean might be a good idea during the winter months if you have psoriasis and live in a cold climate. that’s because the sun’s ultraviolet light turns off the skin’s immune system.&& which is overactive in people with psoriasis. check with your dermatologist before traveling for sun safety skin tips and limit your daily exposure to no more than 10 minutes of direct sunlight..&& anything that injures the skin can cause a psoriasis flare.&& including excessively dry skin..&& the solution: keep your skin moisturized. if you’re allergic to the fragrances in moisturizers.&& use a product that’s fragrance-free to avoid a rash..&& as with dry skin.&& puncturing the skin during a vaccination may cause a psoriasis flare.&& but that’s no reason to skip a needed shot. (4).&& one thing to keep in mind: if you’re on a potent psoriasis medication that suppresses your immune system (such as a biologic treatment).&& you shouldn’t take a live vaccine. your body may not be able to fight off a live virus because of the medication you’re taking. in that case.&& ask your doctor for a vaccine that contains a deactivated virus..&& beta-blockers to treat high blood pressure and lithium for a mental disorder can make psoriasis worse. (5.&& 6).&& if you have high blood pressure.&& your doctor may be able to switch your medication to another drug that won’t affect the psoriasis. if you’re taking lithium.&& your dermatologist may consider having you try light therapy or a topical treatment for psoriasis..&& colds and other infections.&& especially strep throat.&& activate the immune system and can cause psoriasis to flare. (7) if you have psoriasis and develop a sore throat.&& get it treated and be sure to have a culture taken to check for strep. long-term antibiotics may be an option for someone who has psoriasis and frequent sore throats..&& there’s some evidence that smoking can make psoriasis worse. according to a study published in march 2012 in the american journal of epidemiology.&& smokers have almost double the risk of developing psoriasis compared with people who’ve never smoked. (8) in a smaller study published in february 2016 in the international journal of dermatology that looked at twins.&& heavy smokers were more than twice as likely to have psoriasis. (9).&& studies haven’t shown any beneficial effects of taking nutritional supplements for psoriasis.&& but avoiding certain foods may reduce inflammation and help with psoriasis. additionally.&& studies have shown that many people with psoriasis may also have a gluten sensitivity.&& and eating a gluten-free diet can help reduce psoriasis symptoms. (10) in general.&& if you find that a certain food makes the psoriasis worse.&& try to avoid it..&& for some people with psoriasis.&& having more than one or two drinks a day has been shown to cause psoriasis flares.&& but the association is not a strong one. flares from alcohol use could also be linked to psychological stress..&& learn more about psoriasis causes.&& get the facts about the most targeted psoriasis treatment option..&& there are five types of psoriasis.&& yet people most often have only one type of psoriasis at a time. each type has its own set of symptoms..&& also called psoriasis vulgaris.&& plaque psoriasis is the most common form of the skin disease. it appears as raised.&& discolored plaques covered with a scaly buildup of dead skin cells.&& or scales. the itchy.&& sometimes painful plaques can crack and bleed.&& and commonly affect the scalp.&& knees.&& elbows.&& back.&& hands.&& and feet..&& often beginning in childhood or young adulthood.&& guttate psoriasis is the second most common type of psoriasis. nearly 10 percent of people who get psoriasis develop guttate psoriasis.&& according to the npf. guttate psoriasis is the type of psoriasis most closely linked to a recent strep infection. if you develop guttate psoriasis.&& you will also likely be tested for strep bacteria..&& also known as intertriginous psoriasis.&& inverse psoriasis causes red or otherwise discolored lesions in skin folds of the body that may look smooth and shiny. each lesion can occur on the genitals or in areas near the genitals.&& like the upper thighs and groin. its common for people with inverse psoriasis to have another type of psoriasis somewhere else on their body at the same time..&& this causes white blisters of pus that surround red or otherwise discolored skin.&& often on the hands or feet. the pus consists of white blood cells. when pus-filled bumps cover the body.&& you may have bright-red skin and feel ill or exhausted.&& and have a fever.&& chills.&& severe itching.&& rapid pulse.&& loss of appetite.&& or muscle weakness..&& this is a dangerous and rare form of the skin disease characterized by a widespread.&& fiery redness or other discoloration and exfoliation of the skin that causes severe itching and pain. erythrodermic psoriasis occurs once or more in 3 percent of people with psoriasis.&& according to the npf..&& learn more about the types of psoriasis.&& through social media.&& blogging.&& and advocacy.&& these three women are spreading messages of body positivity and community for those who have psoriasis..&& there aren’t any special tests to help doctors diagnose psoriasis. typically.&& a dermatologist will examine your skin and ask about your family history..&& you’ll likely be given a diagnosis based on this physical exam..&& in some situations.&& doctors will remove a small sample of the skin and examine it under a microscope. this might allow them to get a better look at the affected area and make a more accurate diagnosis. (11).&& psoriasis is considered a chronic.&& lifelong condition. there currently isn’t a cure.&& but this skin disorder can worsen or improve..&& for some.&& psoriasis can clear up for months or even years at a time. this is known as remission..&& others experience psoriasis flares in cyclical patterns. for instance.&& the disease may get better in the summer and worsen in the winter. (12).&& check out tippi to see how real people who have psoriatic arthritis (and experts!) answered this question. have a tip of your own? tip it forward!.&& while psoriasis cannot be cured.&& there are effective options for treating it. talk to your doctor about the benefits.&& risks.&& and side effects of any therapies you use..&& some medication to treat psoriasis includes:.&& .&& light therapy.&& such as uvb phototherapy.&& involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural or artificial ultraviolet light to help reduce symptoms of psoriasis. you may receive this treatment alone or along with other medication. (1).&& learn more about psoriasis treatment.&& there’s no way to prevent psoriasis.&& but there are things you can to do to improve your symptoms and help lessen the number of flare-ups you experience. (13).&& some ways to reduce your risk of a psoriasis outbreak include:.&& having psoriasis can increase your risk for developing a number of health conditions.&& including:.&& over the last few years.&& weve seen that maybe psoriasis plays a more integral part in metabolic syndrome.&& a collection of symptoms that can lead to diabetes and heart disease.&& says erin boh.&& md.&& chairman and a professor of dermatology at tulane university in new orleans and a member of the national psoriasis foundation board..&& it is estimated that up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis will also develop psoriatic arthritis.&& an autoimmune disease that affects the joints. according to the national psoriasis foundation.&& psoriasis occurs before joint disease in 85 percent of psoriatic arthritis patients. (15).&& the risks for psoriasis-related complications are greater the younger a patient is when diagnosed and the more severe the psoriasis. (16) anyone with psoriasis should be aware that they are at risk for comorbid conditions and should monitor their overall health accordingly..&& learn more about psoriasis complications.&& according to the national psoriasis foundation.&& about 7.5 million people in the united states have psoriasis. most are white.&& but the skin disease also affects black.&& latino.&& and asian americans as well as native americans and pacific islanders. (17).&& the disease occurs about equally among men and women. according to the national institutes of health (nih).&& it is more common in adults.&& and you are at a greater risk if someone in your family has it. (18) a study published in september 2016 in the journal plos one concluded that “interactions between particular genes as well as genetic and environmental factors play an important role” in the disease’s development. (19).&& people with psoriasis generally see their first symptoms between ages 15 and 30.&& although developing the disease between 50 and 60 years of age is also common. (20).&& “the biggest factor for determining prognosis is the amount of disease someone has.&&” says michael p. heffernan.&& md.&& a dermatologist at the san luis dermatology and laser clinic in san luis obispo.&& california..&& many conditions are closely related to.&& and sometimes mistaken for.&& psoriasis..&& psoriasis and eczema may be tricky to tell apart..&& if psoriasis affects your scalp.&& it might be hard to determine if it’s dandruff or psoriasis..&& other skin conditions like ringworm and pityriasis rosea are occasionally confused with psoriasis..&& like psoriasis.&& eczema is a very itchy skin condition. in fact.&& eczema usually results in a more intense itch than psoriasis. scratching causes inflammation of the skin.&& leading to a worsening of the eczema. scratching can also cause a secondary bacterial infection..&& eczema is not a specific disease.&& but rather a term referring to a group of rash-like conditions. the most common type of eczema is caused by a reaction to irritants.&& like detergents.&& soaps.&& or household cleansers..&& eczema often shows up on the back of the knees or the inside of the elbows..&& eczema can affect anyone and affects children more than psoriasis does. (21).&& more than half of all psoriasis patients have scalp psoriasis.&& according to the npf. (22) itchy plaques can extend beyond the hairline onto the forehead.&& neck.&& and around the ears..&& most people with scalp psoriasis have it on other parts of their body as well.&& says dina d. strachan.&& md.&& a dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at nyu langone medical center in new york city..&& scalp psoriasis is sometimes confused with seborrheic dermatitis.&& or dandruff. according to dr. strachan.&& dandruff — which causes a flaky.&& itchy scalp without signs of inflammation — tends to itch more than scalp psoriasis. “it has a greasy-appearing yellow scale.&&” strachan says. “in contrast.&& psoriasis — whether its on your scalp or any other body part — tends to have a thick.&& silvery scale..&& learn more about whether that rash is psoriasis.&& eczema.&& or something else.&& learn more about scalp psoriasis.&& psoriasis is less common in bipoc (black.&& indigenous.&& and people of color) populations compared with white ones.&& but it may be

40 percent less likely to see a dermatologist for their psoriasis than non-hispanic white americans.&& regardless of their health insurance or socioeconomic status..&& one reason more people of color
