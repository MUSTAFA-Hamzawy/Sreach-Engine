(though other actresses in the supervillain realm tilt toward camp.&& olsen understands that when you’re hovering in midair and wearing a red tiara.&& things are already arch enough.).&& but six marvel projects in.&& is this the kind of big-screen career she expected? not exactly..&& “it took me away from the physical ability to do certain jobs that i thought were more aligned with the things i enjoyed as an audience member.&&” olsen said. “and this is me being the most honest.”.&& olsen had known she wanted to act since she was a child.&& but she also knew she didn’t want to act as a child. any curiosity she might have had about fame was quieted by growing up alongside her sisters mary-kate and ashley.&& who were cast in “full house” before they were even a year old. the life-warping scrutiny of stardom could wait..&& anyway.&& she felt far more comfortable in a group. olsen played high school volleyball and sparked to the team’s camaraderie: everyone could have their solo moment.&& but they had to work together to succeed. even in college.&& when she started to audition for movies.&& she was in no rush to leave the theatrical ensemble she had come through school with..&& but film acting isn’t always as egalitarian. in 2011.&& olsen stormed the sundance film festival with a pair of star vehicles: “silent house.&&” a single-take thriller that keeps its lens trained on her for 87 minutes.&& and “martha marcy may marlene.&&” which cast her as an ex-cult member struggling to move on. that one-two punch led people to dub her the “it girl” of park city.&& but as movers and shakers queued up in the snow to meet her.&& olsen didn’t trust a thing they said..&& “it really felt like everyone was speaking through both sides of their mouth.&&” she said. “i was like.&& ‘this is a bubble.’ it felt like i was literally in a snow globe.”.&& she came out of that experience knowing just two things: she didn’t want to be typecast as the crying indie girl.&& but she didn’t want to be thrust right into big-budget movies.&& either. “that looked scary to me.&& that kind of pressure.&&” she said..&& still.&& sometimes it’s nice to be invited to the party. a few years into her acting career.&& after a streak of low-key indies.&& she asked her agent why she was never in the running for higher-profile movies. the reply: “people don’t think that you want to do them.”.&& did she? that’s a question olsen had to ask herself then — and still does.&& from time to time. she decided she needed to put herself out there more.&& and signed on to a 2014 remake of “godzilla.&&” reasoning that at least it was directed by gareth edwards.&& who until then had been an independent filmmaker..&& and then came the role of wanda.&& and with her.&& entrée into hollywood’s biggest franchise. as olsen mulled marvel’s offer to star in “avengers: age of ultron.&&” she listed the pros: it would defy her indie typecasting. she’d once again be part of an ensemble.&& albeit a superpowered one. and her “godzilla” co-star aaron taylor-johnson was willing to come aboard as wanda’s brother.&& pietro.&& ensuring she wouldn’t go it alone. they signed on to “ultron” as a pair..&& but pietro was killed off at the end of that film.&& and as a shaken wanda continued on through the marvel cinematic universe.&& wondering if she really fit in.&& olsen pondered the same question. because of her marvel commitments.&& she had to turn down a starring role in the yorgos lanthimos dark comedy “the lobster.&&” and it didn’t take a multiverse for olsen to imagine how that film would have propelled her down an entirely different path as an actress..&& “i started to feel frustrated.&&” she said. “i had this job security but i was losing these pieces that i felt were more part of my being. and the further i got away from that.&& the less i became considered for it.”.&& her initial contract with marvel covered two starring roles and a cameo.&& though marvel movies are so mammoth that the studio could have deemed the five weeks olsen spent filming “captain america: civil war” a brief appearance. and while her rising profile helped get indie films like “wind river” and “ingrid goes west” financed.&& she still wondered whether wanda’s spell-casting was worth it in the end. had she become typecast in a totally different way? and was it all building to something that mattered?.&& wanda was killed off at the end of “avengers: infinity war.&&” satisfying olsen’s three-film contract. “the power to choose to continue was important to me.&&” she said. and around the time the marvel studios head.&& kevin feige.&& brought olsen in to discuss a resurrection for “avengers: endgame.&&” he pitched “wandavision” to her. at first.&& she wondered if it was a demotion: tv.&& really? but the more she wrapped her head around it.&& the more she realized it was her wildest screen opportunity yet..&& “the falcon and the winter soldier” was supposed to be marvel’s first disney+ series.&& an old-fashioned.&& down-the-middle action show in which the superheroes punch evildoers in every hourlong episode. “wandavision.&&” by contrast.&& was a half-hour sitcom parody; the most significant fights of the show were marital squabbles.&& leavened by an eerie laugh track..&& “we thought what we were doing was so weird and didn’t know if we had an audience for it.&& so there was a freedom to it.&&” olsen said. “there was no pressure.&& no fear. it was a really healthy experience.”.&& but after the pandemic pushed marvel to rejigger the order of its disney+ series.&& “wandavision” went first and became the unlikely standard-bearer. the show spawned countless memes.&& crashed the streaming service multiple times.&& and earned 23 emmy nominations.&& including a best actress nod for olsen..&& more important.&& “wandavision” helped her fall in love with wanda — a character she had played for years — for the very first time. the show offered a dizzying array of variations on the role — some sitcom-sparkly.&& others modern and morose — and the first episode.&& shot in front of a live audience.&& required all of olsen’s theatrical training to succeed. she wasn’t sure it would resonate with a wider audience until friends sent her video clips of a minneapolis brunch where drag queens had dressed as all of wanda’s alter egos. “if you make it to that stage.&&” olsen said with a laugh.&& “then you actually are part of culture.”.&& with scarlett johansson’s black widow out of the picture.&& olsen is now the marvel actress with the most hours clocked. does she feel reinvigorated enough.&& after “wandavision” and “doctor strange.&&” that she’d be willing to star in a solo film about her character?.&& “i think i would.&&” she said. “but it really needs to be a good story. i think these films are best when it’s not about creating content.&& but about having a very strong point of view — not because you need to have a three-picture plan.”.&& now that she feels more comfortable in her signature role and in her own skin.&& olsen wants to be more deliberate in her choice of roles and what she does with them. but she also told me a story from her understudy days about jeremy irons.&& who didn’t fully learn his lines until opening night of “impressionism”; even through previews.&& he would muck around in front of the audience.&& exit the stage to peruse his pages.&& then come back on to muck some more. maybe acting wasn’t something you trapped.&& pinned down and obsessively studied.&& olsen realized then. maybe you could embrace it as a fluid thing with an unknown destination..&& olsen knows now that a hollywood career can take turns that you never could have predicted.&& so you might as well enjoy where it goes. over the weekend.&& she popped up on “saturday night live” to support her co-star benedict cumberbatch; she played herself in the sketch.&& while the show’s chloe fineman played olsen’s understudy. sometimes.&& things happen to come full circle like that. sometimes.&& it even feels like magic..&& advertisement][how elizabeth olsen came into her powers, explore the marvel cinematic universe, the popular franchise of superhero films and tv series continues to expand., site information navigation]how elizabeth olsen came into her powers - the new york times[send any friend a story, 10 gift articles, olsen had known, ‘doctor strange in the multiverse of madness’:, ‘moon knight’:, ‘spider-man: no way home’:, ‘shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings’:][give this article give article give this story gift this article, , , 59, send any friend a story as a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. anyone can read what you share. give this article give article give this story gift this article, , , 59, read in app, ‘doctor strange in the multiverse of madness’: with a touch of horror, the franchise’s newest film returns to the world of the mystic arts., ‘moon knight’: in the disney+ mini-series, oscar isaac plays a caped crusader who struggles with dissociative identity disorder., ‘spider-man: no way home’: in the latest installment of the “spider-man” series, the web slinger continues to radiate sweet, earnest decency., ‘shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings’: the superhero originated in comics filled with racist stereotypes. the movie knocked them down., © 2022 the new york times company, nytco, contact us, accessibility, work with us, advertise, t brand studio, your ad choices, privacy policy, terms of service, terms of sale, site map, canada, international, help, subscriptions]
