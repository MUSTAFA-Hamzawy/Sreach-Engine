they also tell you the wrong time. or they just won’t have any info at all. idk how it has good ratings at this point. like i’ve said.&& this app has been going down hill rather than improving. a long time ago i would have said that this app is amazing.&& now i don’t recommend it. you’re better of searching whatever you want to know on google..&& developers what’s the problem. this use to be my favorite app. like am literally on it all the time. a few days before the champions league finals the app started acting up. i placed my bets on different matches.&& and i can’t see any results. another thing from the other day. i can’t see any news.&& any matches. all i see is server error. i logged out and log back in 100 times. thankfully my coins were still there. i deleted and downloaded back that app also a million times and as soon as i click the app- server error - can’t see nothing. come on fix this please. i really enjoy this app. and what’s up with football hero?
