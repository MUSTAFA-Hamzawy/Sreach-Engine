of cookies to their visitors. if you’re wondering what cookies are and what all the fuss is about, you’re not alone., cookies are an important browser feature – if you disable cookies, you’ll find yourself unable to log into websites. while cookies have important, good uses, they also have more questionable uses., cookies are small pieces of information websites store on your computer. cookies only contain bits of text, not anything else. the text can be a user id, session id, or any other text. for example, web pages can be configurable – a web page could have a hide link that hides a certain element on the page. the page can save this setting on your computer with a cookie. when you load the page in the future, the page can examine the cookie and automatically hide the element., if you clear your cookies, you’ll be logged out of all websites and websites won’t remember any settings you’ve changed on them., cookies are very common – you probably have hundreds or even thousands

for car insurance on the news website. the advertisements may not be related to the website you’re currently on, but they will be related to the websites you were visiting before. depending on the advertising network, you may be able to opt out of this – as with the google ads preferences page, which also shows the advertising categories you’ve been assigned by google based on the websites you’ve been tracked across., , tracking networks can also use the data for other purposes – for example, selling aggregated browsing data to others., you can manage your browser’s cookies
