yuanyuan dong, andrew v. goldberg, alexander noe, nikos parotsidis, mauricio g. c. resende, quico spaen operations research forum 2021 we present a set of new instances of the maximum weight independent set problem. these instances are derived from a real-world vehicle routing problem and are challenging to solve in part because of their large size. we present instances with up to 881 thousand nodes and 383 million edges. operations research and optimization, ex³: explainable attribute-aware item-set recommendations yikun xian, tong zhao, jin li, jim chan, andrey kan, jun ma, xin luna dong, christos faloutsos, george karypis, s. muthukrishnan, yongfeng zhang recsys 2021 2021 existing recommender systems in the e-commerce domain primarily focus on generating a set of relevant items as recommendations; however, few existing systems utilize underlying item attributes as a key organizing principle in presenting recommendations to users. mining important attributes of items from customer perspectives and presenting them along with item sets as recommendations can provide users more operations research and optimization, system simulations for mimo antenna designs mehrbod mohajer, seyed yahya mortazavi,, essam elkhouly, chen chen ieee aps/ursi 2021 2021 this paper proposes a simulation methodology to optimize mimo antenna designs for the system performance parameters. the proposed design flow provides a co-simulation bench to evaluate mimo antenna designs with system-level criteria. in one example, two mimo antenna designs are considered, where both of them meet conventional antenna design parameters. the proposed methodology identifies the antenna design operations research and optimization, getting your package to the right place: supervised machine learning for geolocation george forman ecml-pkdd 2021 2021 amazon last mile strives to learn an accurate delivery point for each address by using the noisy gps locations reported from past deliveries. centroids and other center-finding methods do not serve well, because the noise is consistently biased. the problem calls for supervised machine learning, but how? we addressed it with a novel adaptation of learning to rank from the information retrieval domain. this related: using learning-to-rank to precisely locate where to deliver packages information and knowledge management, flow-based attribution in graphical models: a recursive shapley approach raghav singal, george michailidis, hoiyi ng icml 2021 2021 we study the attribution problem in a graphical model, wherein the objective is to quantify how the effect of changes at the source nodes propagates through the graph. we develop a modelagnostic flow-based attribution method, called recursive shapley value (rsv). rsv generalizes a number of existing node-based methods and uniquely satisfies a set of flow-based axioms. in addition to admitting a natural operations research and optimization, xiuli chao appointed
