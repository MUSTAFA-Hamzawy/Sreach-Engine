liver. your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body., ldl stands for low-density lipoproteins. it is sometimes called the bad cholesterol because a high ldl level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries., the first test should be between ages 9 to 11, children should have the test again every 5 years, some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke, younger adults should have the test every 5 years, men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years, eat a
