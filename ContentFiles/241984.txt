[cut off from each other by roads and development.&& the cats have a dangerous lack of genetic diversity—but there is hope on the horizon..&& los angeles is the only major metropolitan area in the world with a bevy of mountain lions.&& hunting and breeding in the hills above gleaming houses and suburbs. some of these intrepid cats have become famous.&& such as the bachelor p22.&& which inhabits griffith park.&& a hilly region home to the iconic hollywood sign..&& but these large cats—also called cougars—are in trouble. new research shows that they are seriously inbred due to habitat fragmentation.&& caused primarily by major roads and highways.&& especially route 101.&& which restrict movement and gene flow. unless connectivity is increased by creating what’s known as wildlife corridors.&& these l.a. lions are likely to become locally extinct in the coming decades.&& experts say..&& in a study published recently in the journal theriogenology.&& scientists found that nine mountain lions in the los angeles area have either very high levels of abnormal sperm or possess kinked tails.&& both signs of a serious lack of genetic diversity. two cats also had testicular abnormalities.&& which are likewise known to be manifestations of inbreeding. with only several dozen lions in the l.a. region.&& this result represents a significant proportion of the overall population. .&& some of these indicators—observed between december 2019 and december 2020.&& both as part of standard research efforts and roadkill necropsies—appear in the lions throughout the metropolitan area and its outskirts. prior to this study.&& only one cat had been observed in the region with a kinked tail.&& in 2019..&& “we’ve just reached a tipping point genetically.&&” says audra huffmeyer.&& a postdoctoral researcher in conservation biology at the university of california.&& los angeles.&& and a national geographic explorer. .&& to survive long-term.&& more mountain lions need to be free to move into and out of the two most isolated areas where the animals live—in the santa monica mountains northwest of the city.&& and the santa anas.&& to the southeast. .&& luckily for the cougars.&& a large new wildlife overpass will soon be constructed over the 101 to allow the animals safe passage. the project’s ceremonial groundbreaking took place on april 22.&& 2022—earth day—and will open in 2025..&& “i think this crossing can stave off extinction” for the santa monica population.&& says study co-author seth riley.&& a wildlife ecologist with the u.s. national park service who also teaches at ucla. “we are very confident that it will be super helpful for everything [wildlife].&& including mountain lions… by increasing connectivity.” .&& mountain lions once roamed throughout the majority of what is now the continental u.s. widespread hunting.&& often government-sponsored.&& greatly reduced the cats’ range.&& mostly to the western part of the country.&& by the mid-1900s. the felines.&& which live throughout much of central and south america.&& are also known as cougars.&& pumas.&& catamounts.&& and their scientific name.&& puma concolor..&& florida panthers.&& currently recognized by the government as a subspecies of mountain lion.&& managed to hang on in the wilds of south florida. but they become seriously inbred.&& with no connection to any other population.&& developing high levels of malformed sperm.&& testicular deformities.&& and kinked tails. this population was rescued by the 1995 introduction of eight female texas cougars.&& five of which bred with the florida panthers.&& reversing the population’s decline and improving genetic diversity.  .&& in the 1980s.&& before their genetic rescue.&& three-quarters of florida panthers observed had kinked tails and more than half had testicular abnormalities—a far greater proportion than is seen in southern california today.&& says dave onorato.&& a researcher with the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission who wasn’t involved in this study. .&& but in los angeles.&& onorato says.&& “they are starting to see the signs.&& and that probably warrants getting the alarm bells ringing.” (learn more: how america’s most endangered cat could help save florida.).&& riley and many collaborators have been researching mountain lions in the los angeles region for two decades..&& to conduct the most recent study.&& huffmeyer and colleagues collected observations of mountain lion sightings throughout the los angeles area. around a dozen of the cats live in the santa monica mountains.&& and up to 12 more reside to the north.&& in the santa susanas.&& a range separated by highway 101. around 20 live in the santa anas.&& southeast of the city.&& and considerably more live in the eastern peninsular range.&& further inland.&& according to winston vickers and justin dellinger.&& biologists with the wildlife health center at uc davis school of veterinary medicine..&& between december 2019 and december 2020.&& the researchers observed three animals with kinked tails in the santa monica and santa susana populations using camera traps. a fourth.&& which researchers examined in person in the santa monica mountains.&& had only one descended testicle.&& and a kinked tail.  .&& huffmeyer also tested sperm quality in five cats that died from being shot.&& killed by rat poison.&& or hit by a car—from the santa monica.&& santa ana.&& and eastern peninsular range populations. on average.&& 93 percent of these cats’ sperm was malformed. that’s a high number—about the same percentage of deformed sperm seen in florida panthers before they were genetically rescued.&& onorato says.  .&& to increase genetic diversity.&& more cats need to be able to travel in and out of these isolated populations. on april 22.&& a consortium of environmental groups broke ground on the wallis annenberg wildlife crossing. the $90-million bridge will cross over 10 lanes of traffic on the 101 freeway and allow mountain lions.&& coyotes.&& deer.&& and many other creatures to pass between the santa monica and santa susana mountains..&& the passage was chosen to be located in the agoura hills.&& a rugged region which wildlife are naturally funneled toward.&& and researchers have no doubt it will be used by wildlife.&& especially wide-ranging species such as lions. .&& but more wildlife crossings will be needed to save cougars.&& for example across interstate 15.&& which separates the santa anas from mountain lion populations to the east. translocation.&& or physically bringing in cougars from elsewhere to supplement the population’s diversity.&& might be considered one day.&& huffmeyer says. but it’s a last resort. .&& for now.&& scientists look forward to the completion of the new crossing on the 101—and to the mountain lions that could pass over. .&& “you don’t need a huge number to make a big difference genetically.&&” riley says. .&& copyright © 1996-2015 national geographic societycopyright © 2015-2022 national geographic partners.&& llc. all rights reserved][los angeles mountain lions are becoming
