[.&& many words or phrases can be used to set up an explanation. the most common is because (or “because of”).&& but others have their uses. here are alternatives and a discussion of their uses and their merits..&& 1. as: as is a direct synonym for because (for example.&& “he opted not to go see the movie.&& as it had gotten poor reviews”).&& but it’s inferior..&& 2. as a result of: this phrase is a substitute for “because of.&&” not because.&& as in “as a result of his intervention.&& the case was reopened and they were ultimately exonerated.”.&& 3. as long as: this informal equivalent of because is used to express the thought that given that one thing is occurring or will occur or is true.&& another is possible.&& in such statements as “as long as you’re going.&& could you pick some things up for me?”.&& 4. being as (or being as how or being that): this phrase has the same sense — and the same formality — as “as long as.”.&& 5. considering that: this phrase is essentially identical in meaning to “as long as” and “being as” and its variants..&& 6. due to: like “as a result of.&&” “due to” is a preposition.&& rather than a conjunction like because.&& and is used in place not of because alone but instead of “because of.” it applies specifically to an explanation of why something occurred or will or will not occur.&& as in “due to the large number of applications.&& we cannot respond individually to each applicant.”.&& 7. for: this substitute for because is reserved for poetic usage.&& as in “let us eat and drink.&& for tomorrow we die.”.&& 8. inasmuch as: this phrase is a very formal equivalent of because.&& as in “inasmuch as his account has been discredited.&& i wouldn’t believe anything else he says.”.&& 9. in view of the fact that: this phrase is identical in sense to “inasmuch as.”.&& 10. now that: this phrase informally connotes cause and effect.&& as in “now that you’re here.&& we can proceed.”.&& 11. out of: this phrase applies to explanations of emotion or feeling — for example.&& “she asked out of compassion” or “out of spite.&& i refrained from passing the message along.”.&& 12. owing to: this phrase is equivalent to “due to”; the two choices are more formal than “because of.”.&& 13. seeing that: this phrase is identical to “considering that.”.&& 14. since: this alternative to because is informal and is considered inferior because since primarily refers to elapsed time and the usage might be confused.&& as in “since it had rained.&& we didn’t need to water the garden”; the reader might not realize until reading the second half of the sentence that the sense is causal rather than temporal..&& 15. thanks to: this equivalent of “because of.&&” despite the wording.&& can apply to either a positive or a negative outcome; “thanks to your meddling.&& we’re receiving much unwanted attention” demonstrates the latter sense..&& 16. through: through is a preposition; it takes the place of “because of.&&” as in “through the efforts of these charities.&& the city’s homeless services have been reinstated.”.&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day?
