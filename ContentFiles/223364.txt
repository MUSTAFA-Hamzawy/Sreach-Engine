team works around the clock to iron out details and supply swiss players with vital information they need through casino reviews so that they end up at the right casino provider. we regularly check the fairness and reliability of the casino sites in our review directory along with the software developers they partner with, promo terms and quality of customer support., online casinos that pose as trustworthy when they’re not actually swiss compatible often stand out for having questionable regulatory bodies and licenses. every casino reviewed and rated by us is guaranteed to have both a legit license and reputable regulatory body. what’s more is, casinonow only lists the most trusted online casino providers in switzerland so you can avoid playing at an unlicensed casino that is not regulated for fairness or reliability., with strict laws in switzerland, combined with recent legislation changes, navigating the swiss casino market can sometimes be a bit tricky. luckily our staff

enthusiasts with years of industry experience, but we can see things from a customer point of view and relay this perspective in our best online casino reviews., what’s more is, we are active in online communities and regularly speak with casino enthusiasts for their thoughts and feedback on the online casinos they are playing at. this allows us to combine a number of viewpoints to write a detailed and comprehensive review that allows potential customers to read so that they can make an informed decision., in addition, we browse a number of genuine and reputable review sites to compile the pros and cons from real customers in order to provide a better overall gambling experience to our visitors., without doubt, the available online casino games is one of the most important aspects of a provider when reading casino reviews. if the casino lacks on the game front, then it can have a serious impact on the overall rating and ranking of a casino., even if the casino site offers the best user interface and most generous bonuses, if the games don’t fair up in terms of quantity and quality then it’s an instant point dropper. what’s more is, due to the fierce competition of casinos, there really is no excuse for providing poor quality games in this day and age., within our casino reviews, we aim to provide our visitors with three main categories when it comes to games: how many are available to play (on both pc and mobile devices), what software developer supplies the games and how many classic, exclusive and new games are available., without software developers, online casinos are nothing. this is because the online casino, in most instances, does not make their own games. instead the company strikes deals with software developers around the world, who specialise in creating games for the igaming industry., over the years, due to advances in technology, more games have been able to be developed by software giants and this allows casinos to offer its players a wider range of games, including: slots, table games, card games, fixed odds and live dealer games., all of our best online casino reviews show you exactly what software developers are partnered with each casino so that you can get an idea of the range of games they offer. top developers at casinos in switzerland include: pragmatic play, netent, betsoft and microgaming., when you read a review of a particular casino site, you will probably notice that they offer new customers a promotional bonus. this is standard in the gambling industry and the majority of swiss online casinos follow suit. new player promos are designed to attract and entice new players to the casino site as a thank you for becoming a member., one of the reasons why we list bonuses is that it is often a deciding factor in a player’s decision to sign up. aside from new player bonuses, which are also referred to as first deposit or welcome bonus, there are many other deals used by online casinos to get your juices flowing, these include: loyalty bonus, vip offers, free spins and no deposit bonus., live dealer casino games are considered fairly new when we talk about the online gambling industry as a whole. however, since their introduction they have rocketed in popularity and are now one of the most sought out games to play online, particularly live roulette and live blackjack., across our directory of online casino reviews, you will quickly notice that we have a dedicated section for games that feature live dealers. so if you like the idea of getting a taste of a real casino atmosphere without leaving the comfort of your sofa, pay close attention to live dealer reviews that offer some of the best quality providers along with new casino brands for live gaming., to gamble online using your money, you will need a way to transfer swiss francs from your bank account to your chosen online casino. this is known as ‘depositing’ and can be done so in a number of ways in switzerland., regardless of your level of casino or gambling experience online, player help and support is one factor highlighted in our online casino reviews because of their importance. when something needs resolving or a problem arises, you want someone to turn to in order to rectify it. this is why support is important., reputable online casinos should offer a variety of support channels so that you can get your query dealt with in as timely manner as possible. in our casino reviews we always highlight the methods of support available and the times in which you can receive support., at casinonow, we believe the best support is via live chat with a customer service agent available 24 hours a day. some casino sites limit the support options to email only and are only available during set times, such as 9am-11pm., in 2020, you’re unlikely to find an online casino that is not mobile compatible and even though some providers don’t have a dedicated app, they do provide mobile gambling via your phones web browser. mobile web browser gambling is universal, meaning that the sophisticated technology that casino providers use will work on any operating system, including ios and android., what’s

casino before and are based in switzerland, then we are here to help you get started on your casino journey. knowing what to look for when scouring the internet for an online casino can not only save you hours of your time, but making the right decision from the start can see you pocket more swiss francs., foreign online casinos used to be able to operate in switzerland via a series of loopholes, allowing swiss residents to play casino games online for real money. however, laws in switzerland have now banned foreign gambling providers from providing access to games, instead the swiss gambling industry has become in-house. this means that only online casinos that are approved to operate in switzerland may offer real money games to swiss players., the internet is like a gigantic ocean for online gambling. there are literally thousands of resources available online – swimming around waiting for your attention, including casino providers. since the rise of online gambling over the last 20 years, the igaming industry is still booming and now switzerland has opened the door to many new swiss casinos that players can enjoy., since the relaxation of gambling laws in switzerland, many online casinos have been eager to get a slice of the swiss market. however, the government, whilst relaxing some laws, tightened others – shutting the door on foreign casino providers tapping in to market. that doesn’t mean there isn’t choice though. swiss players have access to plenty of online casinos in switzerland and new local casino sites are launching all the time., at swiss online casinos, players can deposit and withdraw cash in a number of ways. depending on the provider, who sets their own payment methods, players can deposit real money to play games with then withdraw and winnings to the same account. casinos in switzerland allow players to use popular methods: visa, mastercard and bank transfer, along with third party e-wallets: skrill, neteller, entropay and paysafecard. in addition, some online casinos in switzerland are bitcoin compatible, allowing players to play using the virtual cryptocurrency., the rtp of online casinos in switzerland can be highly competitive, meaning that many of the providers compete with bigger names due to the generous and welcome return to player ratio. depending on the casino game you play, the rtp varies at swiss casinos from 95% to 98%. often the less-known or newly established casino sites will have a more competitive rtp as a tactic to attract new players., chief editor, michael dreher is a passionate lover of the

swiss casino reviews conclusion, online casino reviews switzerland – faq 2022, the first method of depositing to a casino is direct, whereby your real cash funds are transferred from point a (your bank) to point b (the casino). debit and credit cards are usually the most popular method in this scenario., the second way of depositing is to use a third party payment processor (e-wallet), such as skrill or neteller. using an e-wallet allows you to transfer money to the e-wallet, then from the e-wallet to the casino. at times this can be more time consuming and some casinos do not offer bonuses for e-wallets, but it is beneficial for players who do not want to disclose sensitive financial details to the casino provider, but still able to play real money games., the third method is cryptocurrencies, which are increasingly gaining popularity in switzerland today., your first port of call should be an online casino review site such as casinonow – that lets you read reviews not only from gambling experts, but other real customers of each casino too. after all, there is often no better recommendation than word of mouth – and online reviews are practically the word of mouth of modern times., another important point to watch for is the terms and conditions of each casino. by reading the terms of the casino provider, you can gain an insight in to the type of experience they provide – including bonus conditions and withdrawal limits. this is particularly important should you run into difficulty – and is often a problematic area when the player doesn’t fully understand the strings attached to certain promos and feels as though the casino is withholding their cash., safety and security,, games and software,, promos and bonuses,, payments,, design and user experience,,
