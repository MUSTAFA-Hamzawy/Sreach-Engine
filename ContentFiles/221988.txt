in fact, the timespan between the first and last observation was less than 30 hours, and resulted in a poor knowledge of the object's orbit that made the object effectively lost just a few weeks after discovery. these circumstances prevented observers from improving the orbit in either of the two classical ways, i.e. via new observations or via precovery searches: there was no way to know where the object was located any other time except for the few days around the time of discovery., in order to assess the situation more clearly, thanks to the support of the catalina team, we were able to retrieve the original fits images exposed by their two telescopes at the time. this gave us the possibility to re-measure them astrometrically with tools available today, and in particular using esa’s gaia catalogue as source of reference stars. gaia’s exquisite astrometric precision allowed us to extract more accurate measurements of the object’s position in 2009. even more importantly, it was now possible to assess the accuracy of our positional measurements to a much better level, thanks to gaia’s unbiased determination of our reference systems in the sky., this new information, extracted from existing data but with new tools that were not available at the time, was then used by our team to reassess the impact risk posed by 2009 jf1. the results were interesting: the impact probability for may dropped to just 1 in 1 700 000, and the asteroid has now lost its prominence in our risk list, and is relegated together with other more routine objects that pose minimal threat., this experiment proves the importance of an astrometric catalogue like gaia, and of a proper determination of measurement uncertainties, in the context of solar system dynamics. it also shows how essential it is to preserve and properly archive original observational data for posterity, since they can provide information that was not usable at the time of acquisition, but becomes crucial at a later time., , the plots in the figure show the coordinate of the earth on the plane of the ecliptic (at the origin) and the possible positions of the asteroid, for the time of the predicted impact. points within the 1-sigma uncertainty region are given in red, the 2-sigma in yellow and the 3-sigma in green. the scale of the axes is expressed in earth radii. the left plot refers to the old solution, before the remeasurements; the cloud of points clearly passes through the reference system origin (thus impacting the earth). the right plot corresponds to the new solution after the remeasurements; its smaller uncertainty now shows no impacting solutions within the 3-sigma boundary. credit: esa / neocc., the esa neo coordination centre has released the may newsletter., large nea steadily going out of the long-term risk list, latest news, copyright 2000 - 2022 european space agency. all rights reserved.][near-earth objects coordination centre, 2009 jf1 kicked out of the risk list top-ten thanks to observation re-measurements - 2009 jf1 kicked out of the risk list top-ten thanks to observation re-measurements, ]2009 jf1 kicked out of the risk list top-ten thanks to observation re-measurements - 2009 jf1 kicked out of the risk list top-ten thanks to observation re-measurements - neo[][neocc home, about neocc, european space agency, space safety programme safety and security planetary defence office space weather space debris clean space, safety and security, planetary defence office, space weather, space debris, clean space, main services risk list close approaches list priority list newsletters archive cafs archive news archive, risk list, close approaches list, priority list, newsletters archive, cafs archive, news archive, search asteroids comets fits images fireballs, asteroids, comets, fits images, fireballs, tools orbit visualiser neo population generator neo propagator, orbit visualiser, neo population generator, neo propagator, outreach neo chronology discovery statistics neocc riddles media entries gallery public outreach definitions & assumptions faq pdc 2021 impact exercise, neo chronology, discovery statistics, neocc riddles, media entries, gallery, public outreach, definitions & assumptions, faq, pdc 2021 impact exercise, external links precoveries through ssois fireballs through imo iawn smpag other links, precoveries through ssois, fireballs through imo, iawn, smpag, other links, other system status automated data access subscribe to services contact us terms & conditions privacy policy, system status, automated data access, subscribe to services, contact us, terms & conditions, privacy policy, european space agency, space safety programme safety and security planetary defence office space weather space debris clean space, safety and security, planetary defence office, space weather, space debris, clean space, contact us, sign in, main neocc home about neocc, neocc home, about neocc, main services risk list close approaches list priority list newsletters archive cafs archive news archive, risk list, close approaches list, priority list, newsletters archive, cafs archive, news archive, search asteroids comets fits images fireballs, asteroids, comets, fits images, fireballs, tools orbit visualiser neo population generator neo propagator, orbit visualiser, neo population generator, neo propagator, outreach discovery statistics neo chronology neocc riddles media entries gallery public outreach definitions & assumptions faq pdc 2021 impact exercise, discovery statistics, neo chronology, neocc riddles, media entries, gallery, public outreach, definitions & assumptions, faq, pdc 2021 impact exercise, external links precoveries through ssois fireballs through imo iawn smpag other links, precoveries through ssois, fireballs through imo, iawn, smpag, other links, other system status automated data access subscribe to services contact us, system status, automated data access, subscribe to services, contact us, , , , system status, terms & conditions, privacy policy]
