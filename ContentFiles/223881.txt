later, landing as our best online casinos in canada in 2020., live baccarat, live blackjack, live roulette, live hold’em, live 3 card poker, any live casino that attracts players from canada is equipped to do business with us. the live casino industry survives because of players’ bets. this means these casinos accept deposits and pay out winnings with canadian dollars. yet many of them also accept bitcoin payments from players throughout canada. the best online live casino for canadians is one that offers them all the highest quality games. for these casinos, this means live casino dealer games of the classics such as roulette and blackjack. these games are a staple of any live casino online. they are the bread and butter of the industry., above you will our top ten overall online casinos in canada in terms of best bonuses and selection of live games available. to help you decide which online casino is best for you, below you will further detail of our top three picks: jackpot city, leo vegas, and spin casino., spin casino is our third casino, well-known in the canadian market and a popular choice for many players. so, what makes spin casino so special? founded in 2002, and later rebranded from spin palace, spin casino has seen it all, knowing exactly what players want and need from an online live casino experience.at spin casino, you will find a large number of deposit methods, including e-wallets, daily promotions and bonuses for regular players, on top of a vip program with a 100% deposit match., however, one potential disadvantage is that there is no mobile app. players can play on mobile but must use their browser instead. nevertheless, the site is mobile compatible and runs smoothly, so long as you have a steady internet connection., leo vegas is a top casino choice for many, especially those in canada. this is thanks to their extensive selection of games, both live and regular, their generous welcome offer, quick payout, and generous bonuses for regular players. founded in 2012, leo vegas has been dominating the online live casino market for over a decade, providing high-quality casino games for all users. there is also a mobile app available on the respective app stores, allowing you to play your favourite live table or casino games on the go., jackpot city is a canadian online casino offering new users lucrative sign-up bonuses, a wide selection of live games, slots, and ginormous jackpots to be won, each and every day. established in 1998 by digimedia limited casinos, jackpot city has been around for over two decades. utilizing microgaming software, jackpot city is able to deliver a large selection of live table games and live dealer games, offering that authentic experience to all users., numerous reasons are given by canadian players for joining any live casino online. they can’t get enough of them because:, there are a few things players should be on the lookout for. finding the best live online casinos is a process. casinonow states that the best way to do it is to read reviews from other players when choosing the best option from the list above. those who already have experience with a casino can speak to whether it’s worth joining or not., it also pays to thoroughly explore a particular online casino before deciding whether or not to join it. ideally, players want one where they can engage in a live casino dealer game at any time. while this isn’t a problem for larger casinos, smaller ones often limit the hours their live casino operates. live casinos usually offer exciting promotions to get players in the door. it is best to read the terms of each promotion when choosing a live casino online. this way, players know exactly what they are getting into before they register for an account., to decide which online live casinos ranked best in our list (or made the list in the first place), we ran each of these casinos through our testing criteria., the criteria were as follows:, now that you know our testing criteria for each casino, it’s time to discuss live casinos for beginners., as a beginner, it can be difficult figuring out the basics concerning live casinos. how do you start playing? what games are available? what software does the casino use? are online casinos fair? you likely have more questions, these will be answered below, providing you with an introductory guide to live casinos, helping even the most beginner player up the ranks and into their first game of blackjack., for this particular example, we will be using spin casino, showing you how to sign-up and start playing., as a beginner to live casinos, we recommend taking the time to work your way around the site. look for bonuses, further offers, and any guidance if there’s any available. likewise, if you don’t already know how to play certain games, you want to slowly begin learning these. you can do this by reading guides online, watching videos on youtube, or playing yourself with a lower stake or with computer players, otherwise known as npcs., regardless of whether you end up playing on jackpot city, spin casino, or leo vegas, you’ll have a wide selection of live casino games at your disposal. the most popular live casino games are roulette, baccarat, blackjack and poker. however, there are other games available if you’re interested. the following sections will further explain live casino games, including rtp and the selection of games you can play., rtp stands for return to player. this is essentially the amount a slot pays back to the player over a set number of spins or games. this number is usually represented as a percentage. for example, the standard rtp for games is around 80%, with some casinos going up to the high 90s. however, this depends on both the casino and the game you’re playing. below you will find the rtp of classic live casino games., understandably, players want to play games that have the highest rtp. games with a higher rtp percentage should hypothetically result in either a higher payout or at least their stake back within a certain number of games. this is what players look for and what you should look for too., live roulette is one of the most popular and simple games available. players choose a colour; black or red and place a wager on this. if the ball lands on your chosen colour, you win. roulette can be made harder by betting on specific numbers e.g. red 27, 30, or 23. the ball must land on these numbers to win. popular versions of roulette in canada include:, live blackjack is an easy to learn casino favourite for players. playing live allows you to interact with a real-time dealer but enjoying the fun and excitement anywhere in the world. the ultimate goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. if you go over 21, you are bust and the dealer wins regardless of your hand. each player starts with two cards, players ask to ‘hit’ for another card whilst one of the dealer’s cards is hidden until the end. popular versions of blackjack in canada include:, baccarat is an exciting game involving both cards and chips. each game of baccarat has three possible outcomes: player win, banker win, and a tie. in-game, players can bet on either their own hard or the bankers, depending on their judgement. whilst baccarat may take a little to learn, it’s a rewarding and fun game to play both online and in-person. popular versions of baccarat in canada include:, besides roulette, live poker is definitely one of the most popular live and in-person casino games. players are dealt five cards, followed by a round of betting. players can fold, raise, call, or go all-in. playing online is a little different from in-person as you cannot see the emotion on a player’s face, this makes it more difficult to see whether or not they are bluffing. nevertheless, popular versions of live poker in canada include:, alongside roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and poker, there are also various other live games on offer. these games include the popular monopoly live, deal or no deal, dream catcher, and various other live casino games. however, the choice of live casino games available is casino dependent. for example, different live casino games are available at jackpot city compared to leo vegas and spin casino., in terms of live casino software, there is currently very little competition of choice for larger casinos. these two most popular options are evolution gaming and microgaming. both spin casino and jackpot city use microgaming whereas leo vegas uses evolution gaming. evolution gaming, in particular, offers responsive, and world-leading casino games on tablets and smart devices, creating a unique and authentic gaming experience (they also offer desktop too)., on the other hand, microgaming themselves have the largest progressive jackpot network in the world. in total, they have paid out over $1 billion dollars to date. likewise, back in 2015, microgaming set the guinness world record for the largest payout in an online slot machine game. a player at betway uk won €17,879,645,12 from a 25p spin., the majority of mainstream live casinos are both fair and secure. live casinos, in general, show you the action first hand, this increases the fairness of the game, then say playing regular video poker., however, you should pay attention to a few safeguards to ensure the casino is secure:, if you’re ever unsure whether a not a casino is secure, it’s worth digging around and reading their privacy policy, ensuring they have a security certificate, and looking at their rngs. random number generators are the algorithm casinos use to deal their games. all casinos recommended in this article are completely secure and fair. you’ll find the majority of casinos are. with that being said, avoid less mainstream casinos, especially those who do not meet these safeguards., many online live casinos will offer a welcome bonus, an act to convince you to sign-up and gamble with them., jackpot city currently offers a $1,600 cad deposit bonus for new players. this is split over four deposits, matched up to $400 cad. whilst this is a deposit bonus, you can also use this in live games. likewise, regularly playing at a live dealer casino rewards you with unique daily bonuses, depending on your gaming experience., spin casino offers a massive $1,000 cad deposit bonus for first-time live casino sign-ups. this is awarded and split over your first few deposits. once signed-up, you will also regularly be rewarded with further promotions for playing., finally, our third and final casino recommendation is leo vegas. leo vegas have numerous fantastic live casino bonuses, including a deposit bonus of up to $300 cad and a live casino welcome offer of up to $500 cad matched deposit. , many online live casinos also have a mobile application, available on smartphones and other smart and portable devices. these apps can be downloaded from the respective app stores, allowing you to play your favourite live games on the go., however, some casinos, including spin casino do not have a mobile app. instead, and this applies to most online live casinos, you can play via the browser on your device. this is fully supported and almost as seamless as a mobile app. nonetheless, jackpot city and leo vegas do have a mobile app, both of which are fully supported., there are many payment options available from live online casinos. below you can see an extensive list of the payment options you will have available to you from different online casinos., some casinos don’t allow you to withdraw money using the same method that you deposited money with. the withdrawal limit for casinos will differ from one casino to the next, this limit can be discovered on the casinos website, or you can ask their customer support. this also goes for the deposit limit. the withdrawal time can also vary from casino to casino, it usually could take around 72 hours for a payment to process or up to 5 days., when playing at a live casino, it’s important to know the rules. however, fortunately, thanks to modern technology you don’t need to worry so much about breaking any laws. instead, this is based more on netiquette; essentially doing things the right way, the way they are supposed to be done. should you violate the netiquette, this will lead to either a timeban or permanent ban in the live chat or casino as a whole., when using an online live casino:, live dealers are often overlooked, however, they are an integral component of the online live casino gambling experience. did you know:, with the average salary being toward the lower end, live casino dealers often rely on their tips to make a means. likewise, most live casinos run 24/7, with dealers allowed to work any shift on top of their regular schedule. also, taking time off is relatively easy, as there are many replacement live dealers on hand 24/7 – just think, if there wasn’t then the casinos couldn’t run…, playing at a live casino for your first time can be a daunting experience, with so many games to choose from, the option to chat live with other players, and bonuses and promotions bombarding your screen. to help you along, our experts have prepared a list of tips for playing live casinos, you can see these below:, over the last few years, the popularity of live casinos has increased exponentially, and understandably so. now, players can gamble at their favourite table games with a live dealer and real players from the comfort of their own home – what more can you ask for?, with the increase in popularity, more and more casinos are placing greater emphasis on their online experience. new bonuses are regularly made available, supplementary live games are added, and new features and bonuses awarded to regular players., live casinos are relatively new, closely replicating real-life casinos. this allows players to place bets and play their favourite games from the comfort of their own home, interacting with live dealers and other players via a live chat or in some cases a video option. with such a wide choice of games available, there’s often more selection than in a real casino, all without the hassle of queuing for games and trying to find your way to the exit once you’re done., all live casino games are honest and reliable. unlike regular casino games such as video poker or roulette, the action is happening in real-time with a real dealer. you’re seeing the action first hand and able to interact with this,
