[smart home intents for discovery and control of local devices..&& received when a constants.eventtype event is sent from the platform. currently only available for ble seamless setup projects. for

platform. currently only available for ble seamless setup projects. for more details.&& see parsenotificationhandler..&& sent when the user clicks setup on google home app to initiate device setup. currently only available for ble seamless setup projects. for more details.&& see provisionhandler..&& a proxy is selected for reachable devices. for more details.&& see proxyselectedhandler..&& fetch the state of the device. for more details.&& see queryhandler..&& report additional devices connected through a local proxy or hub. for more details.&& see reachabledeviceshandler..&& sent after a device is provisioned to ask for types and traits information. the purpose of the local intent is equivalent to the sync intent sent to your cloud fulfillment.&& so the logic for locally processing the intent resembles how you handle it in the cloud. currently only available for ble seamless setup projects. for more details.&& see registerhandler..&& sent when the user chooses to unlink from
