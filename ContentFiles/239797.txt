[the test suite for smart home is a web application that allows you to self-test your smart home action. the test suite automatically generates and runs test cases based on the devices and traits associated with your account. when you complete the tests.&& you can view the test results or fill in the submission form to submit the test results to google..&& the tests executed by the test suite include.&& but are not limited to.&& the following:.&& checks that report state and request sync are implemented for your devices and traits..&& verifies that the query intent is implemented for your device and its results match report state results..&& you can launch the test suite tool by clicking the button below:.&& launch test suite.&& the following section describes how to run the test suite on your device and smart home action project. the test suite requires you to sign in so that it can inspect devices in your home graph and send commands directly to google assistant..&& to self-test your action.&& follow these steps:.&& sign-in to google using the top-right corner button..&& configure the project details:.&& configure test settings:.&& if certifying your smart home action.&& make sure the test request sync option is enabled—during testing.&& you will be prompted to add.&& update.&& or remove a device and check if the device list has changed in home graph. change actions take place through the integration you are testing. your integration under test must always have at least one device attached to the agent user..&& if you are using a scene trait.&& select test scene trait..&& perform a test run and view results:.&& view the results & submission page:.&& the test results include the number of tests passed and failed.&& and a final score indicating percentage of passes..&& account linking plays an important role in the google smart home ecosystem. the account linking validation test in test suite checks your oauth service for potential issues..&& the account linking validation test contains tests to validate access tokens and refresh tokens:.&& access tokens returned from your token exchange endpoint are tested to ensure they have a valid format and are returned with a valid refresh token..&& refresh tokens are tested to ensure your token exchange endpoint properly exchanges them for new access tokens..&& the following table lists some common error messages you may encounter and the suggested way to resolve them..&& your test suite results must pass 100% of tests before submitting your certification form. if you have any traits that require manual testing.&& you should still run the test suite tool and attach the result even if it has not passed at 100%..&& to submit your test results and certify your smart home action.&& follow these

settings: if certifying your smart home action, leave the default report state/request sync timeout value unchanged. however, for testing, you may change the timeout value if your agent takes more time to report state to home graph. if certifying your smart home action, make sure the test request sync option is enabled—during testing, you will be prompted to add, update, or remove a device and check if the device list has changed in home graph. change actions take place through the integration you are testing. your integration under test must always have at least one device attached to the agent user. warning: when removing a device, make sure to do this from your third-party app (not from the google home app). do not remove the device if there is only one device in your app that is account-linked, as this will cause a sync error. if you are using a scene trait, select test scene trait. note: if you want to test traits with secondary user verification, select the enable secondary user verification option in the test settings page. when this setting is enabled, the test app prompts you if the device responds with a challenge during the test. this option is only to help you
