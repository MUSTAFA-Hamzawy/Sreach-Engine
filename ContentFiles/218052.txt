additional apis and be subject to varying policies., for the purposes of this policy, the term “action” applies to either the action project or individual actions within that project. this policy applies to all aspects of actions, including their content, advertising content (where permitted), behavior, and listing information in the directory., avoiding a policy violation is always better than managing one, but when violations do occur, we’re committed to ensuring developers understand how they can bring their action into compliance., if your action violates our policy, you will receive a notification with a specific reason for removal or rejection. repeated or serious violations of the policy may result in termination of individual, related or partner accounts., we may take action based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, a pattern of harmful behavior or high risk of abuse. we identify risk of abuse based on factors including, but not limited to, previous violation history, user feedback, and use of popular brands, characters, and other assets., we may also limit the discoverability of your action if it is low quality (such as failing to gracefully handle user queries), unhealthy (such as crashing or exiting unexpectedly), limited in purpose (only useful to a small set of users), or contains content that is inappropriate for most audiences. please note that actions on google only allows submissions of actions by developers who are 18 years of age or older at the time of the submission. see here for more information about our

that may be inappropriate for a general audience, or frequently has profanity, it must include a disclaimer at the beginning of the user’s first conversation with the action and in the assistant directory description., here are some examples of content that may require a disclaimer:, if your action seeks to offend users, including for humour, or includes content that may be offensive for a general audience, your action’s discoverability may be restricted., user-generated content (ugc) is content that a user contributes to an action, and which is visible to or accessible by at least a subset of the action’s users. if your action contains ugc, it must include a disclaimer indicating as such at the beginning of the user’s first conversation with the action and in the assistant directory description., we don’t allow actions whose primary purpose is featuring objectionable ugc. similarly, actions that end up being used primarily for sharing objectionable ugc, or that develop a reputation among users of being a place where such content thrives, will also be removed., here are some examples of violations:, we don't allow actions or developer accounts that infringe the intellectual property rights of others, including trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and other proprietary rights. we also don't allow actions that encourage or induce infringement of intellectual property rights., we will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. for more information or to file a digital millennium copyright act request, please visit our

if you can't reach a resolution with the developer, please submit a trademark complaint through this form., we don't allow actions that mislead users by impersonating someone else (e.g., another developer, company, entity) or another action, or falsely applying affiliation. this includes misusing icons, descriptions, display names, or other action features that could mislead users., here are some examples of violations:, we don’t allow actions that infringe copyright. modifying copyrighted content may still lead to a violation. developers may be required to provide evidence of their rights to use copyrighted content., please be careful when using copyrighted content to demonstrate the functionality of your action. in general, the safest approach is to create something that’s original., here are some examples of copyrighted content that is often used without authorization or a legally valid reason:, we don't allow actions that induce or encourage copyright infringement. before you publish your action, look for ways it may be encouraging copyright infringement and get legal advice if necessary., here are some examples of violations:, we don't allow actions that infringe on others' trademarks. a trademark is a word, symbol, or combination that identifies the source of a good or service. once acquired, a trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to the trademark usage with respect to certain goods or services., trademark infringement is the improper or unauthorized use of an identical or similar trademark in a way that is likely to cause confusion as to the source of that product. if your action uses another party's trademarks in a way that is likely to cause confusion, your action may be removed., we don't allow actions that sell or promote

interfere with device or assistant functionality, such as lights, notifications or warnings., examples of prohibited behavior include:, at a minimum, actions should provide users with a basic degree of functionality and a respectful user experience. actions that crash, or exhibit other behavior that is not consistent with a functional user experience are not allowed. this includes incomplete actions that may have been submitted as a test., we don't allow actions that spam users or the directory, through unsolicited or repetitive activity. these actions do not expand the catalog in a meaningful way., here are some examples of violations:, we don’t allow actions that send sms, email or other messages on behalf of the user without giving the user the ability to confirm the content and intended recipients., we don’t allow actions whose primary purpose is to drive affiliate traffic to a website or provide a webview of a website without permission from the website owner or administrator., here are some examples of violations:, we don't allow actions that merely provide the same experience as other actions already on the actions on google platform. actions should provide value to users through the creation of unique content or services., here are some examples of violations:, you must be transparent in how you handle user data (e.g., information provided by a user, collected about a user, and collected about a user's use of the action or device). this policy establishes the directory's minimum privacy requirements; you or your action may need to comply with additional restrictions or procedures if required by an applicable law. for additional privacy requirements concerning actions for families, please refer to the actions for families program requirements., all actions must:, provide a link to a privacy policy in the directory's designated field, the privacy policy must, together with any in-action disclosures, comprehensively disclose how your action collects, uses, and shares user data, including the types of parties with whom it's shared. it must be written in each of the languages your action is enabled for. you must limit your use of the data to the activities described in the disclosures. you must allow google crawlers to access and scan the content of the privacy document., handle all user data securely, all transmissions of user data must use modern cryptography, and your action's interaction with the actions on google apis must use https., request sensitive user data via the permissions api, all requests for a user's location and name., accurately describe the reason for requesting user data or implement account linking, you must clearly and accurately disclose the legitimate business reason for requesting user data including email, telephone number, date of birth, gender or personal preferences. if you are using the permissions api you must disclose this in the "context" field in the corresponding method., actions are prohibited from requesting the following data via the conversational interface (text, image or speech) in all scenarios., payment or financial data, examples: credit and bank account numbers. refer to the financial services policy., authentication data, examples: this includes full or partial passwords or pins., identity data, examples: passport number, national id number, social security number, drivers license number or tax ids., healthcare data, refer to the health policy., sensitive personal information, examples: requesting an individual's ethnicity, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation., you may use google sign-in and/or the account linking api with oauth 2 to create a link between a google user and an existing non-google account on your system. when implementing account linking using oauth, you must own your oauth endpoint or have control over it with an oauth service provider. do not provide urls from identity providers directly in your actions on google configuration. only one oauth config per action package is permitted., don't use any other method to associate a google user with an account on your system, including using an association from another action engaging in account linking, or requesting an email or phone number. for example, if you offer multiple actions requiring account linking, each action must independently use the account linking api — using the configuration defined in the respective action package — to associate the google user with the existing account., if you initiate account linking mid-conversation, then prior to triggering the account linking process you must explain why you are prompting the user to link their account., don't request any oauth scope from google unless the user is signing in to your service using google sign-in. don't encourage users to agree to additional google oauth scopes by directing them to a website or action., if google is unable to review and test the action’s account linking capability, it will not be approved. this includes actions that provide invalid credentials for testing, or fail to keep their credentials updated., we don't allow actions that steal data, secretly monitor or harm users or that are otherwise malicious., we don't allow actions that interfere with, disrupt, damage, or access in an unauthorized manner the user's device or other devices, computers, servers, networks, application programming interfaces (apis), or services. this includes other actions, any google service, and the device's network., all actions that collect user data must comply with the user data policy and fully disclose their functions., the following are explicitly prohibited:, actions and their listings on the directory must not provide any means to activate or access functionality that violate these terms., if your action is associated with a security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise another action, application, device, or service, we may remove it to protect users., if you provide us with catalogs, menus, or other data via a data feed or other mechanism, the data must comply with these policies, including the sections on prohibited content and intellectual property. you must correctly implement all technical requirements and provide content for all required fields. the data provided must be relevant to the use case of feed and accurate. we may disable the feed (or a portion of it), disable use of the data, or remove any related actions for violations of these policies or if they create a poor user experience., no in-conversation ads are permitted., we don't allow actions that directly or indirectly engage in or benefit from promotional practices that are deceptive or harmful to users or the developer ecosystem. this includes actions that engage in the following behavior:, it is your responsibility to ensure that any ad networks or affiliates associated with your action comply with these policies and do not employ any prohibited promotion practices., all actions must comply with these requirements:, the following purchases and transactions (any agreement between a user and a business to fulfill a good or service) are supported on actions on google:, physical goods or services including:, digital goods or services including:, currently, actions on google do not support money transfers from one user to another, either directly or via a licensed money transmitter or donations to charitable or political entities. this restriction does not apply to app actions., all actions implementing the transactions api, digital purchase api (a google play billing service), or using direct actions (including the food order direct action api) must comply with these requirements:, for actions using the digital purchase api only:, for actions using the transactions api only (as google does not provide these features):, your action’s pronunciation and assistant display name is how users interact with and discover actions. your action's listing dramatically affects the directory's quality, so avoid spammy listings, low quality promotion, and anything that artificially boosts your action's visibility. fill out all of the details required for the directory listing, including providing visible, non-blank icons., your action’s directory listing (including name, descriptions, etc.) must comply with the prohibited content and intellectual property policies and not include words that are vulgar, sexually explicit, or offensive., all actions must have a phonetically unique pronunciation that will allow users to trigger the action's functionality. action pronunciations are unique within each language, so once a name is approved, no other action can register the same phonetic name in the same language. your directory listing must have at least one sample pronunciation, all of which must include your action’s name, for example "talk to google shopping," and consistently triggers your action., names must meet the following requirements:, a name uniquely identifies your action, so it must distinguish itself from other actions and from the assistant’s core features. we don’t allow names that are:, names of people or places are not allowed unless they also contain other words (e.g., bill's horoscope or new york tourism) or you are a government agency of that location (for example, the city of new york can register the name new york city)., some words and phrases are reserved and cannot be used in names, including, ok, google, launch, ask, tell, load, exit quit, volume up, game, action, assistant, skill, and app. test your name in the api dashboard to confirm it doesn't use a reserved word or phrase. we may make exceptions for certain reserved words or phrases if used in a qualifying multi-word combination, if the name isn’t confusing, and if it doesn’t otherwise violate these policies. instructions to request an exception are below., depending on the language, some characters may be prohibited in the display name field; for example, languages using the latin alphabet must contain only lower-case alphabetic characters, spaces between words, possessive apostrophes (e.g., sam's science trivia), or periods used in abbreviations (e.g., a. b. c.). other characters such as numbers must be spelled out (e.g., twenty one)., names must be easy to pronounce correctly and be phonetically distinct to avoid being misinterpreted as similar sounding words or other action names (within the same language). don't use names that are phonetically similar to ones prohibited by these policies, such as vulgar, offensive, generic, or common names, even if spelled differently., in evaluating these policies, we consider the pronunciation of the display name, how it’s spelled in the console, and the commonly accepted way to spell the pronounced word (if there is one)., we will consider exceptions to certain naming policies on a case-by-case basis; you can request an exception filling out this form and requesting display name assistance., examples of generic names:, not allowed:, allowed (for illustrative purposes only and subject to other policies), your action's pronunciation must be a phonetic version of its display name. permitted differences include: punctuation, spaces, and using numerals vs. spelling out numbers and ordinals (such as three vs. 3 or third vs. 3rd)., the description and other metadata of your action must accurately describe its functionality and the services or content it provides. here are a few best practices for writing a description of your action:, user testimonials are not allowed in the action's description., to ensure a great user experience, your action must operate as described, provide a high-quality user experience, and take advantage of the platform's features., actions should follow the guidance for conversation design. actions that significantly deviate from the user-interface design guidance or have poor user experiences may be disabled from specific surfaces, be rejected, or be removed from the directory, including for:, suggesting the action supports a larger scope of commands than it actually does, within the conversation or directory listing., listening for a user command without a prompt such as a greeting, or an implicit or explicit question. this includes opening the action mic to listen or record the user, without setting the expectation. the user must be aware when the action is recording a response or command. examples include:, listening for user responses during an action experience by leaving the mic open with no implicit or explicit prompts and failing to set expectations with the user about the nature of the interaction., failing to function properly on all assistant-enabled devices that support the action’s required capabilities., playing a silent sound file without a clear purpose., misusing interaction features on assistant-enabled devices., continuously playing text-to-speech or recorded audio for longer than 240 seconds unless using the media response api., having broken links or images., branding or labeling your action during the user interaction with terminology associated with a non-google developer platform., failing to provide alternate text and voice for images in non-graphical interfaces., audio not matching visual text and via text-to-speech in graphical interfaces., registering or creating misleading or irrelevant intents to your action., including unnecessary descriptive words, such as adjectives, adverbs, or ambiguous terminology in suggestion chips., in order to establish that developers in the actions for families (aff) program have demonstrated the ability to create family-friendly experiences, we limit eligibility for the program to developers who have already created a teacher approved app on google play or have entered into a partnership agreement with google for their family-friendly action that is in effect. developers whose apps are removed from the teacher approved program and do not have a currently effective partnership agreement with google for their family-friendly action are no longer eligible for actions for families., if your action targets children or provides content explicitly for children, it must participate in the actions for families program under these eligibility requirements, otherwise it will not be approved for release on the platform. this includes both actions targeting children as their primary audience or as one of their audiences., the word “child” can mean different things in different locales and in different contexts. it is important that you consult with your legal counsel to help determine what obligations and restrictions may apply to your action. aff developers can choose to deploy their aff action in every actions on google supported locale except morocco, tunisia, and yemen., before submitting an action to the actions for families program, you are responsible for ensuring your action is appropriate for children and compliant with all relevant laws, including the u.s. children’s online privacy protection act (coppa) and the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr)., actions participating in the actions for families program must meet the eligibility criteria in this section and comply with the terms of service for actions on google, including the actions for families addendum., eligibility criteria, actions accepted to the actions for families program are required to continue to meet the program’s standards at all times, including in subsequent updates. actions may only opt out of the aff program and remain on the actions on google platform if the action no longer targets children as its primary audience or as one of its audiences., google reserves the right to reject or remove any action determined to be inappropriate for the program or ineligible for the actions for families program based on the above criteria., security or surveillance actions must not log personally identifiable information (pii) of individuals outside the primary user without their consent. for example, doorbell actions cannot log information about who may be at the door without the express consent of that individual., we do not allow actions that instruct passenger transport vehicles to move., we will only certify actions that give users the option to choose which voice assistant they can link to. we will not certify actions that require users to connect to another voice assistant before connecting to google assistant., google requires partners to enable a secondary user verification for any operation that may change the device state to a non-secure or disabled state, such as unlocking a door, turning off a camera, disabling a security system, or opening a device that may have a safety concern., while the nature of the security and safety precautions may vary by the type of device, at minimum these devices must require account linking and a secondary user verification, such as confirmation on a secured mobile device or a password/pin. irrespective of the nature of the action (conversational vs. smart home api direct action), adding the additional layer of security is required to comply with google’s policy. however, after the user has established a secondary verification, you may provide an opt-out option for the user. the opt-out language should be precise and clear to the user., google’s recommendation for smart home devices is to implement a direct action using the smart home api. for smart home integrations, the secondary user verification methods are described here., when users search for and buy devices labeled with the ‘works with hey google’ badge, they should expect robust functionality and a safe, reliable, and seamless experience. beyond the secondary user authentication policy above, developers must also meet the following requirements for device certification and use of the ‘works with hey google’ badge:, the google assistant smart home api supports device types and traits to match the functionality of smart home devices. device type representation should be accurate based on the identity of the device itself. for example, if you have a smart switch that controls lights, then the device type that you use is switch, since that represents the nature of the physical device. google provides guides on devices and their required functionality here., additionally, if new device traits are added to a developer’s device, the developer must make that trait accessible to google assistant users at launch. as an example, for color light bulbs, users should be able to change the color of the bulbs, turn the bulbs on and off, adjust the bulbs’ brightness, etc., with google assistant., google reserves the right to not certify submissions if a developer’s device fails to integrate all functionality present on the device with compatible smart home api traits allowing google assistant to provide a complete experience., all devices are expected to report state updates to google through the homegraph api’s report state, with the exception of command-only devices like ir controllers. report state is critical to the proper representation of the device’s state across all assistant surfaces and assistant services. we require that all partners who have device state implement reportstate. for further details see the reportstateandnotifications api in the developer docs., developers shall report device configuration updates in your ecosystem to google; for example if the developer updates functionality like supported traits, or if the user adds, renames, or removes a device, the developer must report those updates to google. this eliminates the need for users to unlink and relink their account to receive updates after they make an update in the developer app. this can be accomplished through the request sync api., cloud connected smart devices should have a persistent connection for cloud control, whether that’s through the device itself, or through a stationary partner hub. mobile devices and tablets cannot be used as intermediaries for smart home devices. for devices with low power states that disconnect the device from its connectivity protocol such as wifi, the device should implement methods to enable waking up the device for cloud control., in order to comply with our legal and privacy policies, oauth page should show that your app is linking / sharing data with google, not google home or google assistant. you must have a google authorization statement such as “by signing in, you are authorizing google to access your devices.”, there are certain devices that may have safety implications, such as cooking appliances that may get hot enough to be a safety concern. for any device that can potentially pose a heightened safety risk, we ask that you share the ul certificate (or similar safety certification) for that device. additional details on safety certificate requirements can be found here., maintaining a high level of performance and reliability is key to jointly delivering helpful user experiences. partners can access metrics on the usage and performance of their integration by visiting their google cloud platform project page. more information on accessing performance metrics can be found here., after the initial certification, developers should maintain an acceptable level of performance for their devices. there are multiple aspects of performance:, quality expectations are outlined on a device type level in the smart home api documentation. persistent failure to meet these expectations could result in your integration having reduced visibility, or in extreme cases being disabled, until performance is improved., smart home api integrations should be recertified when the api has functionality added, or when your device adds new capabilities that are supported by the smart home api. this is inclusive of additional devices that the partner adds to their integration. for example, as new devices are included, the certification requirement must also be met for those devices., additionally, integrations must be recertified every 12 months beginning from when the most recent recertification occurred, or when new device functionality is added. this will ensure you maintain eligibility for the works-with badge and your integration remains in good standing. failure to recertify, will revoke your approval for use of the works-with badge and can potentially lead to one or more enforcement actions against your smart home api integration., these policies do not limit or amend any terms of service or other agreements that apply to the user's use of the applicable google products or services, unless the policies expressly state that they are amending specific terms of service or agreements., if your action has violated any of our policies, we may take one or more enforcement actions against your action or your developer account, as outlined below. in addition, we’ll notify you with relevant information about the enforcement action we’ve taken, along with instructions on how to appeal if you believe we’ve taken enforcement action in error., please note that removal or administrative notices may not indicate each and every policy violation present in your action. developers are responsible for addressing any policy issue and conducting extra due diligence to ensure that the remainder of their action is fully policy compliant. failure to address policy violations in all of your actions may result in additional enforcement actions, including permanent removal of your action or account termination., repeated or serious violations (such as malware, fraud, and actions that may cause user or device harm) of the terms of service or policies for actions on google may result in termination of individual or related actions on google developer accounts., we will reinstate actions if an error was made and we find that your action does not violate the terms of service and policies for actions on google. if you’ve reviewed the policies carefully and feel that our enforcement action may have been in error, please follow the instructions provided in our notice to you to appeal our decision. you can also contact us here., except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the creative commons attribution 4.0 license, and code samples are
