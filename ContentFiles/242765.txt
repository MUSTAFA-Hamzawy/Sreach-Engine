[we recently announced plans to hire 150.&&000 more people in the u.s. ahead of the holidays to help deliver orders for our customers.&& and we wanted to share a bit more about what we’ve been doing since the start of the pandemic to support and protect both our permanent and seasonal employees..&& it starts with paying more than double the federal minimum wage and offering health benefits that start on an employee’s first day on the job.&& which we were already doing before the pandemic started. in 2020 and through the first half of 2021.&& we spent an additional $15 billion across our global fulfillment network to help keep our employees safe as they continued to support our customers..&& this includes things like implementing social distancing measures and making direct investments in employee safety.&& including on-site testing and vaccination clinics. here’s a bit more about some of the things we’ve done:.&& when the pandemic hit.&& we quickly changed many parts of how we work to help keep employees safe. we undertook one of the most comprehensive overhauls of our processes in amazon’s 25-year history.&& including how our facilities were cleaned and how employees were trained. we also implemented social distancing measures.&& temperature checks.&& and other technologies. and we listened to our employees and public health experts and continued to adjust and update our processes regularly when we saw opportunities to do more..&& for example.&& early in the pandemic.&& access to regular and reliable covid-19 testing was scarce around the world. we didn’t wait for others to provide solutions. instead.&& we assembled a team of professionals with a variety of skills—research scientists.&& program managers.&& procurement specialists.&& software engineers—and moved them from their day jobs to focus on creating a scalable covid-19 testing program for their colleagues..&& the initiative included building two diagnostic labs in a matter of months—one in the u.s. and another in the uk. soon after launching.&& the labs were processing thousands of tests per day while continuing to build for more capacity. by october 2020.&& the u.s. lab in kentucky was testing more than 700 employees an hour.&& making access to covid-19 testing available to nearly all front-line employees..&& by january 2021.&& our kentucky lab reached a new milestone after processing 1 million tests for our employees. to date.&& we have processed many millions more across our labs. at the height of the pandemic.&& the labs were processing more than 30.&&000 tests a day. we also worked with public health entities to help the international fight against new strains of the virus..&& hear more from the team that built our in-house covid-19 testing program and what drove their work..&& .&& in december 2020.&& as vaccines started rolling out across the world.&& we immediately began advocating on behalf of our employees to ensure they had access to covid-19 vaccines as early as possible. we also reached out to local.&& state.&& and federal government officials.&& along with public health experts.&& to offer amazon’s logistical support in facilitating vaccine distribution to help protect the health and safety of our employees and communities..&& in march 2021.&& as vaccine supplies were being made available to front-line employees.&& amazon began rolling out on-site vaccination events to make getting vaccinated as easy as possible. the events also helped ease the burden on community-run vaccination clinics. early on.&& our program helped vaccinate front-line employees when public clinics were operating at maximum capacity and accessing vaccines was difficult..&& as vaccine supplies have become more widely available.&& we have continued to host on-site vaccine events to help our front-line employees and their family members. we hosted more than 1.&&800 free vaccination events at amazon facilities across the u.s..&& making the covid-19 vaccines available to more than 1 million amazon employees and their families..&& hear from some of our employees about what access to the vaccines meant to them..&& .&& earlier this year.&& we announced that front-line employees could receive up to $80 ($40 per dose) for getting the covid-19 vaccine.&& whether they received their vaccination off-site or at an amazon-hosted vaccine event. in may.&& we also rolled out a $100 new-hire bonus for fully vaccinated u.s. front-line employees..&& most recently.&& we introduced the amazon “max your vax sweepstakes” for u.s. front-line employees.&& featuring a variety of prizes totaling nearly $2 million. the program incentivized employees with a fun—and potentially lucrative—way to get vaccinated. and we made it easy to participate. u.s. front-line employees who logged their vaccination information showing they were fully vaccinated were automatically entered into the sweepstakes to potentially win one of 18 big money prizes..&& .&& over the past 18 months.&& as workers around the world experienced massive job loss during the pandemic.&& amazon continued to create jobs around the world. in 2020 alone.&& amazon created 500.&&000 new jobs globally and invested billions in additional pay and bonuses for our front-line employees.&& on top of our already strong average starting wage of $18 an hour in the u.s.—more than double the federal minimum wage. in fact.&& a recent wall street journal analysis found that had it not been for amazon.&& the whole job creation by s&p companies would have been negative..&& around the world.&& we know the pandemic is continuing to affect our employees and our communities.&& and we will continue working hard to create solid jobs and support our teams and our communities now and for the long run.][$15b in covid-19-related costs to prioritize employee health and safety, building testing labs to keep our teams safe, helping vaccinate amazon employees and
