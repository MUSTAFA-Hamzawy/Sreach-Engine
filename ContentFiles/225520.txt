2022 dl4c workshop 2022 traditional bug detection mechanisms have focused on a limited set of important issues and have specialized detectors for each of them. as the code corpora continue to grow in size and complexity, newer opportunities for a developer to make mistakes emerge, leading to long tail of local bugs. hence, we must investigate generalizable approaches that can detect such bugs. in this paper, we formulate and use machine learning, fix bugs with transformer through a neural-symbolic edit grammar yaojie hu, xingjian shi, qiang zhou, lee pike iclr 2022 dl4c workshop 2022 we introduce nsedit (neural-symbolic edit), a novel transformer-based code repair method. given only the source code that contains bugs, nsedit predicts an editing sequence that can fix the bugs. the edit grammar is formulated as a regular language, and the transformer uses it as a neural-symbolic scripting interface to generate editing programs. we modify the transformer and add a pointer network to select conversational ai / natural-language processing, hcl: hybrid contrastive learning for graph-based recommendation xiyao ma, zheng gao, qian hu, mohamed abdelhady ijcnn 2022 2022 graph-based collaborative filtering for recommendation has attracted great attention recently, due to its effectiveness of capturing high-order proximity among users and items. to further improve its model robustness and alleviate label-sparsity issue, contrastive learning has been introduced to polish user and item representation by contrasting different views of user/item nodes, learning necessary and machine learning, seqzero: few-shot compositional semantic parsing with sequential prompts and zero-shot models jingfeng yang, haoming jiang, qingyu yin, danqing zhang, bing yin, diyi yang naacl 2022 2022 recent research showed promising results on combining pretrained language models (lms) with canonical utterance for few-shot semantic parsing. the canonical utterance is often lengthy and complex due to the compositional structure of formal languages. learning to generate such canonical utterance requires significant amount of data to reach high performance. fine-tuning with only few-shot

hsu, xing niu, marcello federico, georgiana dinu naacl 2022 2022 the machine translation (mt) task is typically formulated as that of returning a single translation for an input segment. however, in many cases, multiple different translations are valid and the appropriate translation may depend on the intended target audience, characteristics of the speaker, or even the relationship between speakers. specific problems arise when dealing with honorifics, particularly machine learning, amazon and ucla announce recipients of gift awards, graduate fellowships staff writer may 05, 2022 the
