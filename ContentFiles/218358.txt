[web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from march 2011. this uses the new hq software for distributed crawling by kenji nagahashi., what’s in the data set: crawl start date: 09 march, 2011 crawl end date: 23 december, 2011 number of captures: 2,713,676,341 number of unique urls: 2,273,840,159 number of hosts: 29,032,069, the seed list for this crawl was a list of alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date. we used heritrix (3.1.1-snapshot) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. the scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites., however this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed urls to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. for example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the urls for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). we also included repeated crawls of some argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed., we have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with. we have also done some further analysis of the content., if you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it. we may not be able to say “yes” to all requests, since we’re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered., you can ftp mosaic netscape 0.9 beta from the following locations:,     ftp.mcom.com in /netscape     gatekeeper.dec.com in /pub/net/infosys/mosaic-comm     lark.cc.ukans.edu in /netscape     ftp.meer.net in /netscape     doc.ic.ac.uk in /packages/netscape     archie.au in /pub/misc/netscape     ftp.cica.indiana.edu in /pub/pc/win3/winsock/nscape09.zip (pc only)     mac.archive.umich.edu in /mac (mac only), please make sure to read the readme and license files., an up-to-date listing of mirror sites can be obtained at any time by sending email to rele...@mcom.com., subject to the timing and results of this beta cycle, mosaic communications will release mosaic netscape 1.0, also available free for personal use via the internet.  it will be subject to license terms; please review them when and if you obtain mosaic netscape 1.0., a commercial version of mosaic netscape 1.0, including technical support from mosaic communications, will be available upon completion of the beta cycle.  contact us at i...@mcom.com for more information., have fun!, marc and the gang i...@mcom.com, http://mosaic.mcom.com/][account options]here it is, world! - comp.infosystems.www.users | google groups[mar, jun, 2009, 2012][gmail, calendar, documents, photos, reader, web, more sites groups youtube images videos maps news shopping translate books scholar finance blogs realtime even more », sites, groups, youtube, , images, videos, maps, news, shopping, translate, books, scholar, finance, blogs, realtime, , even more », sign in, , groups help, groups help, ]
