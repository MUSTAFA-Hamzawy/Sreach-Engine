features: natural turn-taking pradeep natarajan, arindam mandal, nikko ström september 24, 2020 natural turn-taking uses multiple cues — acoustic, linguistic, and visual — to help alexa interact more naturally, without the need to repeat the wake word. conversational ai / natural-language processing, fpi: failure point isolation in large-scale conversational assistants rinat khaziev, usman shahid, tobias röding, rakesh chada, emir kapanci, pradeep natarajan naacl 2022 2022 large-scale conversational assistants such as cortana, alexa, google assistant and siri process requests through a series of modules for wake word detection, speech recognition, language understanding and response generation. an error in one of these modules can cascade through the system. given the large traffic volumes in these assistants, it is infeasible to manually analyze the data, identify requests conversational ai / natural-language processing, fashionvlp: vision language transformer for fashion retrieval with feedback sonam goenka, zhaoheng zheng, ayush jaiswal, rakesh chada, yue wu, varsha hedau, pradeep natarajan cvpr 2022 2022 fashion image retrieval based on a query pair of reference image and natural language feedback is a challenging task that requires models to assess fashion related information from visual and textual modalities simultaneously. we propose a new vision-language transformer based model, fashionvlp, that brings the prior knowledge contained in large image-text corpora to the domain of fashion image retrieval search and information retrieval, fewshotqa: a framework for few-shot learning of question answering tasks using pre-trained text-to-text models rakesh chada, pradeep natarajan emnlp 2021 2021 the task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. for question answering (qa), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need finetuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. their performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). to address this, we propose a finetuning conversational ai / natural-language processing, error detection in large-scale natural language understanding systems using transformer models rakesh chada, pradeep natarajan, darshan fofadiya, prathap ramachandra acl-ijcnlp 2021 2021 large-scale conversational assistants like alexa, siri, cortana and google assistant process every utterance using multiple models for domain, intent and named entity recognition. given the decoupled nature of model development and large traffic volumes, it is extremely difficult to identify utterances processed erroneously by such systems. we address this challenge to detect domain classification errors conversational ai / natural-language processing, adversarial mask generation for preserving visual privacy aayush gupta, ayush jaiswal, yue wu, vivek yadav, pradeep natarajan fg 2021: ieee international conference on automatic face & gesture recognition 2021 we present a privacy preserving machine learning method for images that separates task-relevant information from task-irrelevant information. our primary hypothesis is that by revealing the minimal number of pixels required for a task we can provide the most privacy preserving guarantees. specifically, we propose an adversarial method that masks out task-irrelevant information from an image for preserving computer vision, courtesy of sergey menis amazon scientist sergey menis
