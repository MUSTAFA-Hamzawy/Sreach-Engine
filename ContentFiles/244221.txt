[.&& nate asks: what are the proper usages of the words “in” and “on” in a sentence? i often confuse the two. here are some examples: “the boat is in/on the water.&&” “we are in/on the planet.&&” “we’re going to the concert in/on july 1st.”.&& the use of prepositions in english is frequently idiomatic. general guidelines exist.&& but be prepared to learn individual expressions in which the preposition does not adhere to the guidelines..&& in the case of the prepositions in and on.&& here are the most usual uses..&& in mainly denotes “rest at”:.&& place: he lives in the country. he lives in chicago. (but.&& he lives at 2300 wabash ave.) time: i’ll be there in an hour. manner: the child ran down the steps in tears. reference: in my opinion we need a referendum. they are happy in their marriage..&& on indicates proximity and position above or outside:.&& place: he sat on the fence. time: he was not thinking well on that occasion. reference: he asked my opinion on the matter. condition: we’ll hire him on your recommendation..&& the examples given in the question:.&& we are on the planet. we are going to the concert on july 1..&& but.&& we are going to the concert in july..&& as for the example about the boat.&& either is correct.&& according to what is meant:.&& the boat is in the water. (as opposed to being on dry land for the winter) the boat is on the water. (look at all those boats out there on the water!).&& however.&& it would be unidiomatic to say the ship is in the ocean or in the sea.&& unless you mean that it has sunk. the ship is on the sea..&& related to the question of when to use in is that of when to use into. while in denotes the state of being “at rest” in a place.&& or at least being (in a sense) surrounded by something.&& into denotes motion towards:.&& the dog jumped into the water. the children (who were already in the water) jumped in the water..&& when deciding whether to use in or into.&& ask yourself if the person or thing you are talking about is moving from one place to another. if so.&& use into..&& more about prepositions in later posts. stay tuned!.&& .&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day? get a subscription and start receiving our writing tips and exercises daily!.&& very good and clear explanation. i never pick up the difference between these words. now i think i have got it almost. i wish i knew it before itself. at least i would have got 5 more marks in the english grammar exercise. thanks for the post maeve..&& honestly daniel that was one great tip. i myself face the problem of deciding where to use on and where to use in but this post summed it up quite well..&& thanks a lot.&& i don’t really get the in/on part for time.&& i must use in if im refeering to a specific time.&& or for the rest of cases.&& right?.&& i’m not sure what “temp” is asking. perhaps a few more time expressions will help: in a minute in twenty minutes in two shakes of a lamb’s tail in a flash on the fourth of july on my birthday it may be necessary to memorize the more common usages. as i mentioned in the post.&& prepositional usage is often idiomatic and difficult to pin down..&& i don’t think i’ve ever been told what a prepositions is. at least i don’t remember..&& please explain preposition. sorry i’m lost at paragraph 2..&& sally.&& prepositions are words that connect nouns and explain their relationship with other words. here are some examples:.&& with at by to in for from of on.&& on an email listserv.&& someone asked.&& why do we say:.&& “in the army but on a soccer team in a political party but on a staff”.&& any suggestions?.&& “the use of prepositions in english is frequently idiomatic. general guidelines exist.&& but be prepared to learn individual expressions in which the preposition does not adhere to the guidelines.”.&& i am sure if there are any explanations for the cases you mentioned in particular..&& prepositions are simple if you understand that they only function to show relationships. here is how i explain them to my students (college freshmen and sophmores)..&& i grab a chair and position myself:.&& i can be beside the chair.&& behind the chair.&& by the chair.&& and beyond the chair..&& i can be in front of the chair.&& in the chair.&& and on the chair..&& if i have some weird obsession.&& i could be into the chair..&& i can be under the chair and.&& if somehow melted together and remade.&& of the chair..&& if the chair is one if my parents.&& i am from the chair. however.&& i could move away from the chair..&& i could walk to the chair. i could stare at the chair. i could move towards the chair..&& i could walk around the chair. i could be above the chair. i could feel certain feelings about the chair..&& i could make many more examples. however.&& that’s not the point..&& regarding the question.&& the word in denotes that the noun is consumed by the object of the preposition . the word on denotes that the noun is above or atop..&& i still don’t get the.&& he was not thinking well on that occasion..&& why is “in” wrong here?.&& great timing–i just heard a clip of joe biden on npr in which he used “on” when he meant “in.”.&& i’ve never personally experienced any confusion about on and in.&& but a friend of mine makes me laugh with her usage.&& which i suspect is dialectic. if she is seated indoors without benefit of chair or other support.&& she claims to be sitting “in” the floor..&& it always triggers a joke from my husband about a man who is instructed to “get on the plane.” the man’s response: “forget that–you get on the plane! i’m getting in the plane.”.&& is it “we participated in a field trip.” or “we participated on a field trip.”?.&& roswell.&& “participated in a field trip” but you’d “go on a field trip.”.&& what about these: “we will go to the beach on monday” or “we will go to the beach monday”? “monday mom baked a pie” or “on monday mom baked a pie”?.&& is it: “his picture was on the paper” or “his picture was in the paper”.&& his picture was in the paper.
