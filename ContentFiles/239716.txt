[.&& this is a list of hypertext transfer protocol (http) response status codes. status codes are issued by a server in response to a clients request made to the server. it includes codes from ietf request for comments (rfcs).&& other specifications.&& and some additional codes used in some common applications of the http. the first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. the message phrases shown are typical.&& but any human-readable alternative may be provided. unless otherwise stated.&& the status code is part of the http/1.1 standard (rfc 7231).[1].&& the internet assigned numbers authority (iana) maintains the official registry of http status codes.[2].&& all http response status codes are separated into five classes or categories. the first digit of the status code defines the class of response.&& while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role. there are five classes defined by the standard:.&& an informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. it is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. it alerts the client to wait for a final response. the message consists only of the status line and optional header fields.&& and is terminated by an empty line. as the http/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes.&& servers must not[note 1] send a 1xx response to an http/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions.[3].&& this class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received.&& understood.&& and accepted.[2].&& this class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. many of these status codes are used in url redirection.[2].&& a user agent may carry out the additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is get or head. a user agent may automatically redirect a request. a user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects.[18].&& this class of status code is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. except when responding to a head request.&& the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation.&& and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. these status codes are applicable to any request method. user agents should display any included entity to the user.[29].&& the server failed to fulfil a request.[60].&& response status codes beginning with the digit 5 indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request. except when responding to a head request.&& the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation.&& and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. likewise.&& user agents should display any included entity to the user. these response codes are applicable to any request method.[61].&& the following codes are not specified by any standard..&& microsofts internet information services (iis) web server expands the 4xx error space to signal errors with the clients request..&& iis sometimes uses additional decimal sub-codes for more specific information.&&[84] however these sub-codes only appear in the response payload and in documentation.&& not in the place of an actual http status code..&& the nginx web server software expands the 4xx error space to signal issues with the clients request.[85][86].&& cloudflares reverse proxy service expands the 5xx series of errors space to signal issues with the origin server.[88].&& amazons elastic load balancing adds a few custom return codes.&& the following caching related warning codes are specified under rfc 7234. unlike the other status codes above.&& these are not sent as the response status in the http protocol.&& but as part of the warning http header.[94][95] since this header is often neither sent by servers nor acknowledged by clients.&& it will soon be obsoleted by the http working group.[96].&& ][list of http status codes, contents, 1xx informational response, 2xx success, 3xx redirection, 4xx client errors, 5xx server errors, unofficial codes, internet information services, nginx, cloudflare, aws elastic load balancer, caching warning codes, see also, notes, references, external links, navigation menu, search]list of http status codes -
