[as war ravages ukraine.&& we are reminded of the true life and death necessity of access to health care. in addition to providing traditional care.&& hospitals.&& clinics.&& and emergency triage centers in the country must care for wounded soldiers and civilians—but they lack critical medical supplies. in the chaos of war.&& doctors and other medical practitioners find themselves with no centralized tool to request and track incoming supplies or monitor capacity at nearby hospitals.&& to better treat the wounded..&& when the ukrainian ministry of health and ukraine public health agencies put out a call for assistance.&& xch—a provider of situational awareness and incident management software tools to support health care providers in times of crisis—stepped up to the challenge. with the support of amazon web services (aws).&& xch launched the ukrainian humanitarian aid and assistance system (uhaas) to facilitate the communications required to provide emergency responders with real-time data for supply management. uhaas builds on capabilities of xch’s existing advanced management system (ams).&& which provides software mapping dashboards which allow users to catalog.&& manage.&& and prioritize supply needs—and get urgent medical supplies into the hands of the doctors and nurses that need them most..&& xch initially expected that building.&& testing.&& and launching uhaas would take up to six months.&& but thanks to the collaboration with aws.&& the new solution was ready in just six weeks. the xch team had to work quickly to create a new solution that combines the functionality of its existing software tools.&& while adding new features to track hospital bed capacity and patient transfers—all while meeting stringent data privacy and security needs..&& aws is supporting this critical effort with cloud computing credits and technical expertise—to accelerate and scale the build. aws also provided free support for deployment.&& compliance requirements.&& and security to make sure the application stays online.&& no matter the circumstances. by integrating amazon translate.&& uhaas harnesses powerful natural language processing capabilities to provide translation assistance.&& helping users overcome language barriers..&& we wouldn’t have been able to get this work done without the aws team.&&” said carl taylor.&& ceo of xch. “not only did they jump at the chance to support us.&& but they moved with incredible speed.”.&& aws continues to work with xhc to increase the ease of use of uhaas for the health care professionals and aid workers who depend on its capabilities every day.][aws-powered app helps healthcare workers track supplies in ukraine, amazon news, how a ham and cheese sandwich got its own algorithm,
