[most people experience abdominal discomfort or pain at some point in their lives. abdominal pain (sometimes called stomachache or bellyache) is usually felt in the part of the trunk below the ribs, above the pelvis and the groin. it can range in intensity from a mild ache to severe, disabling pain., while abdominal pain isn’t normal, it isn’t necessarily serious, and it often resolves itself., , abdominal pain may take several different forms. in addition to how severe it is, abdominal pain can be described in the following ways:, generalized pain this refers to pain felt in more than half of your abdominal area, and is typical of stomach viruses, indigestion, or gas as the cause of your pain., localized pain this refers to pain felt in just one area of your abdomen, and is typical of a problem with an organ like your stomach, appendix, or gallbladder as the cause of your pain., cramping this type of pain come and goes, or changes in its severity or perceived position in your abdomen. cramping is rarely serious and is typical of gas, passing a stool, or menstruation as the cause of your pain., , it’s important to call your doctor if your abdominal pain is so severe that you can’t move without feeling more pain, or sit still in a comfortable position., , while we don’t usually feel the inner workings of our abdomen, pain can occur when there is a disruption of the normal functioning of an organ or area of tissue inside., abdominal pain can be caused by inflammation (as in appendicitis, diverticulitis, or colitis), organ distention or stretching (as in an intestinal obstruction or blockage of a bile duct by gallstones), or loss of blood supply (as in ischemic colitis)., some prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as dietary supplements, can cause stomach pain. medications can do this by irritating the stomach, leading to nausea, pain, and diarrhea, or by slowing digestion, leading to constipation. be sure to check the label of any drug you take to see if abdominal pain is listed as a possible side effect., , , , , the cause of abdominal pain is diagnosed based on your symptom history, a physical examination, and testing, if needed. your doctor is likely to ask you questions about the characteristics of your pain, and whether you have any underlying physical or mental health conditions that could be contributing to your abdominal pain., questions from your doctor may address the following aspects of your abdominal pain:, your doctor may also ask about your overall health history, any recent injuries, and whether you might be pregnant., , how long your abdominal pain lasts, and whether it gets better or worse, will depend on the cause of your pain and how the pain responds to any treatments., many forms of abdominal pain tend to respond to self-care measures or simply get better on their own, including pain caused by constipation, food allergies or intolerances, or stomach viruses., , abdominal pain can be brief or long-lasting, depending on its underlying cause. it can be ongoing or recurring, coming and going at what seem like random intervals or with certain activities or behaviors., how long your abdominal pain lasts, or whether it comes and goes, doesn’t necessarily correspond to how severe the underlying condition is., , , mild abdominal pain due to digestive upset may respond to short-term self-care measures such as the following:, , , , , , in many cases, abdominal pain can be prevented by adopting lifestyle and dietary choices that address the cause of your pain. constipation, digestive upset, and even abdominal injury can often be prevented., the following steps may help you prevent abdominal pain:, , develop regular bowel habits. many people can train themselves to have regular bowel movements to help avoid constipation., follow a balanced, fiber-filled diet. eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, and fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, can help support healthy digestion and reduce constipation., eat regularly and slowly. eating moderately-sized meals, instead of waiting until you’re very hungry and stuffing yourself, can help avoid pain from overeating or eating on an empty stomach., exercise regularly. getting enough physical activity can help prevent constipation and strengthen your abdominal muscles, which may help prevent straining., , , in addition, many of the underlying conditions that cause abdominal pain can lead to serious complications, including the possibility of structural damage to the digestive system from infection, cancer and its treatments, and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd)., to reduce the risk of complications, it’s important to seek medical attention for your abdominal pain if it’s sudden and severe, or if it includes symptoms like fever, bloody stool, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, or visible swelling., , , it’s harder to determine how many people experience chronic abdominal pain, since it can be caused by a variety of health conditions and doesn’t always come with a clear diagnosis., , , , some of the most common conditions associated with abdominal pain include the following:, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) this condition is characterized by symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, and bloating., constipation if you aren’t having regular bowel movements, you may feel bloated and full and experience sharp gas pains in your abdomen., peptic ulcer when a sore develops in the lining of your stomach or upper small intestine, you may experience a burning sensation similar to hunger pangs, along with nausea, vomiting, or heartburn., pancreatitis inflammation of your pancreas may cause sharp, severe pain in the upper middle area of your abdomen, along with nausea, vomiting, or
