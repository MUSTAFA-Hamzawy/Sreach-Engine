[rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints. within the body.&& joints are the points where bones come together and allow for movement. most of these joints — those called synovial joints — also provide shock absorption..&& ra is an autoimmune condition.&& in which your immune system mistakes the linings of your joints as foreign and attacks and damages them.&& resulting in inflammation and pain..&& .&& rheumatoid arthritis is a complex disease that is not well understood by medical practitioners or researchers..&& .&& .&& if youre experiencing ra symptoms.&& its crucial to get diagnosed as soon as possible so that you can receive prompt treatment..&& learn more about rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms.&& ra develops when white blood cells.&& which normally protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses.&& enter the synovium (the thin tissue that lines the synovial joints). inflammation ensues — the synovium thickens.&& causing swelling.&& redness.&& warmth.&& and pain in the synovial joint..&& .&& researchers dont know exactly what causes the immune system to invade the synovium.&& but its believed that genes and environmental factors play a role in the development of ra..&& .&& .&& but not everyone with these identified gene variants develops ra.&& and people without them can still develop it. so.&& its likely that environmental factors often trigger the disease.&& particularly in people with a genetic makeup that makes them more susceptible to it. these factors include:.&& .&& .&& .&& .&& children up to age 16 who experience prolonged swollen or painful joints anywhere in the body are typically diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia)..&& learn more about juvenile idiopathic arthritis: symptoms.&& causes.&& diagnosis.&& and treatment.&&  .&& while no single test can definitively diagnose ra.&& doctors consider several factors when evaluating a person for rheumatoid arthritis..&& the diagnostic process typically begins when a doctor gets your medical history and conducts a physical exam. they will ask you about your symptoms to look for signs of ra.&& in particular things like prolonged joint swelling and morning stiffness that lasts at least half an hour after you wake up..&& next.&& your doctor will order blood tests to detect rheumatoid factor (rf) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (acpas).&& which can be specific markers for ra and could indicate ra. you can still have symmetrical inflammatory arthritis with or without systemic markers of inflammation..&& .&& in the future.&& doctors may be able to diagnose ra using (noninvasive) infrared light..&& rheumatoid arthritis is classified as either seropositive or seronegative..&& people with seropositive ra have acpas.&& also called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides.&& found in their blood test. these antibodies attack the synovial joints and produce symptoms of ra..&& .&& people with seronegative ra have the disease without the presence of the antibodies or rf in their blood..&& learn more about diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis: tests and screenings.&& early diagnosis.&& and your doctors.&& .&& .&& but remission doesnt happen for everyone.&& and because the pain and other symptoms of ra may change over time.&& pain management can be an ongoing concern. in addition to pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids.&& there are many options for pain relief for people living with ra. these include.&& among others:.&& learn more about how rheumatoid arthritis progresses.&& to treat ra.&& doctors aim to stop the progression of the disease by reducing symptoms.&& controlling inflammation.&& minimizing joint and organ damage.&& and improving physical function..&& proven treatments include medication and physical therapy. early.&& aggressive measures can help control symptoms and complications before the disease significantly worsens.&& by reducing or altogether stopping inflammation as quickly as possible..&& .&& in recent years.&& there have been significant advancements in medicines for treating ra.&& but there is still no cure. medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards) are considered the gold standard for ra treatment..&& .&& in general.&& these drugs work by slowing the inflammation and protecting the joints from further damage.&& and are generally prescribed shortly after diagnosis. the type of dmard a doctor prescribes depends on several factors.&& including disease severity and the balance between the medications benefits and potential side effects..&& biologics and jak inhibitors are newer options alongside traditional dmards. traditional dmards target the entire immune system.&& while biologics work by targeting specific steps in the inflammatory process.&& and jak inhibitors block action in your body to help prevent the inflammation before it starts. traditional dmards are usually taken in pill form.&& as are jak inhibitors; biologics are typically injected or delivered via an intravenous infusion..&& .&& .&& related: new medication guidelines for treating rheumatoid arthritis released.&& learn more about rheumatoid arthritis medications.&& certain lifestyle changes and home remedies may be beneficial — in addition to the conventional treatment of medication.&& physical therapy.&& and surgery — if needed..&& .&& relaxation techniques.&& visualization exercises.&& group counseling.&& and psychotherapy can help reduce the stress of living with ra. sleeping well is also an important part of managing symptoms..&& you should always check with your medical provider before trying any complementary or alternative therapies..&& learn more about alternative therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.&& many people can manage ra with medication and physical therapy.&& but joint surgery may be an option if your joint damage is severe and limiting your quality of life..&& learn more about treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: medications.&& alternative and complementary therapies.&& surgery options.&& and more.&& its well established that rheumatic diseases such as ra increase the risks for developing a variety of health conditions..&& the most common ra comorbidity is cardiovascular disease.&& but the condition is also associated with several specific cardiovascular issues.&& including heart attack.&& stroke.&& congestive heart failure.&& peripheral vascular disease.&& and atherosclerosis..&& .&& ra can also lead to inflammation in other areas of the body.&& including blood vessels.&& where its known as rheumatoid vasculitis; the lungs.&& resulting in rheumatoid lung disease or other conditions; the eyes; and the wrists.&& causing carpal tunnel syndrome..&& .&& learn more about the complications of rheumatoid arthritis: how it affects your body in the short and long term.&& while there is a lot of interest in the role of diet and nutrition in symptom management for rheumatoid arthritis.&& there is no comprehensive research on the topic nor is there a dietary magic formula to fight ra symptoms..&& but some evidence suggests that eating certain foods may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms for some people.&& while other foods have been shown to worsen inflammation and related symptoms..&& for instance.&& the ketogenic diet — which is high in fats that promote inflammation and low in certain healthy grains.&& fruits.&& and vegetables that help fight inflammation — is generally believed to be bad for ra symptoms and pain..&& .&& .&& learn more about rheumatoid arthritis and diet.&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& .&& the american college of
