text-to-speech groups research at icassp 2022 may 17, 2022 papers focus on speech conversion and data augmentation — and sometimes both at once. conversational ai / natural-language processing, alexa’s speech recognition research at icassp 2022 may 12, 2022 multimodal training, signal-to-interpretation, and bert rescoring are just a few topics covered by amazon’s 21 speech-related papers. conversational ai / natural-language processing, a quick guide to amazon’s 50-plus icassp papers may 10, 2022 topics range from the predictable, such as speech recognition and signal processing, to time series forecasting and personalization. conversational ai / natural-language processing, conference calendar icassp 2022 conversational ai / natural-language processing may 22 - 27, 2022 acl 2022

sigmod/pods 2022 2022 in 2013, amazon web services revolutionized the data warehousing industry by launching amazon redshift, the first fully-managed, petabyte-scale, enterprise-grade cloud data warehouse. amazon redshift made it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze large volumes of data using existing business intelligence tools. this cloud service was a significant leap from the traditional on-premise data warehousing cloud and systems, retrieval augmented classification for long-tail visual recognition alexander long, wei yin, thalaiyasingam ajanthan, vu nguyen, pulak purkait, ravi garg, chunhua shen, anton van den hengel cvpr 2022 2022 we introduce retrieval augmented classification (rac), a generic approach to augmenting standard image classification pipelines with an explicit retrieval module. rac consists of a standard base image encoder fused with a parallel retrieval branch that queries a non-parametric external memory of pre-encoded images and associated text snippets. we apply rac to the problem of long-tail classification and computer vision, massive-scale decoding for text generation using lattices jiacheng xu, siddhartha reddy jonnalagadda, greg durrett naacl 2022 2022 conditional neural text generation models generate high-quality outputs, but often concentrate around a mode when what we really want is a diverse set of options. we present a search algorithm to construct lattices encoding a massive number of generation options. first, we restructure decoding as a best-first search, which explores the space differently than beam search and improves efficiency by avoiding conversational ai / natural-language processing, improving machine translation formality control with weakly-labelled data augmentation and post editing strategies danial zhang, jiang yu, pragati verma, ashwinkumar ganesan, sarah campbell iwslt 2022 2022 this paper describes amazon alexa ai’s implementation for the iwslt 2022 shared task on formality control. we focus on the unconstrained and supervised task for en→hi (hindi) and en→ja (japanese) pairs where very limited formality annotated data is available. we propose three simple yet effective post editing strategies namely, t-v conversion, utilizing a verb conjugator and seq2seq models in order to rewrite conversational ai / natural-language processing, “the pedestrian next to the lamppost”: adaptive object graphs for better instantaneous mapping avishkar saha, oscar mendez, chris russell, richard bowden cvpr 2022 2022 estimating a semantically segmented bird’s-eye-view (bev) map from a single image has become a popular technique for autonomous control and navigation. however, they show an increase in localization error with distance from the camera. while such an increase in error is entirely expected – localization is harder at distance – much of the drop in performance can be attributed to the cues used by current computer vision, amazon and ucla announce recipients of gift awards, graduate fellowships may 05, 2022 the ucla science hub seeks to address challenges to humanity through research using artificial intelligence, bringing together academic and industry scientists. machine learning, ten teams named for alexa prize simbot challenge february 15, 2022 university teams will compete to develop a bot that best responds to customer commands in a virtual world., johns hopkins university amazon and johns hopkins announce new ai institute april 07, 2022 the jhu + amazon initiative for interactive ai (ai2ai) will be housed in the whiting school of engineering. machine learning, courtesy of sergey menis amazon scientist sergey menis contributes to development of vaccine approach against hiv may 09, 2022 i hope we have
