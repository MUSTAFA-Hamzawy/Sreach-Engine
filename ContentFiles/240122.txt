[to celebrate national library week 2022.&& we are taking readers behind the scenes to meet the librarians who work at the internet archive and in associated programs..&& alexis rossi has always loved books and connecting others with information. after receiving her undergraduate degree in english and creative writing.&& she became a book editor and then worked in online news. .&& in 2006.&& rossi joined the staff of the internet archive. she was working on the launch of the open library project when she recognized the need to learn more about how to best organize materials. she enrolled at san jose state university and earned her master’s of library and information science in 2010..&& “it gave me a better grasp of how to hierarchically organize information in a way that is sensible and useful to other libraries.&&” rossi said. “it also gave me better familiarity with how other more traditional libraries actually work—the types of data and systems they use.”.&& rossi concentrated on web interfaces for library information.&& understanding digital metadata.&& and how to operate as a digital librarian. in addition to overseeing the open library project.&& at the internet archive.&& rossi managed a revamp of the organization’s website.&& ran the wayback machine for four years.&& founded the webwide crawling program.&& and is currently a librarian and director of media & access..&& “one of the themes of my life is trying to empower people to do whatever they want to do.&&” said rossi.&& who grew up in monterey.&& california.&& and now lives in san francisco. “giving people the resources to teach themselves—whatever they want to learn—is my driving force.”.&& “giving people the resources to teach themselves—whatever they want to learn—is my driving force.”.&& rossi acknowledges she is privileged to have means to avail herself to an abundance of information.&& while many in other parts of the world do not. there are so many societal problems she cannot solve.&& rossi said.&& but she believes her work is making a contribution.  .&& “we can build a library that allows people to access information for free.&& wherever they are.&& and however they can get to it.&& in whatever way. that.&& to me.&& is incredibly important.&&” rossi said. it’s also rewarding to help patrons discover new information and recover materials they may have thought were lost.&& she added..&& when she’s not working.&& rossi enjoys making funky jewelry and elaborate cakes (a skill she learned on youtube)..&& among the millions of items and collections in the internet archive.&& what is rossi’s favorite? video and audio recordings of her dad.&& now 73.&& playing the piano.&& organ and accordion: “it’s just so good. it’s such a perfect little piece of history.”.&& as a teenager in the 1940s.&& ben smith became a huge fan of swing and big-band music — especially the masterful duke ellington.&& known for the classics “mood indigo” and “take the ‘a’ train.” .&& smith started collecting ellington records in 78rpm format in high school and continued during world war ii when he served in the air force stationed in various u.s. cities before being deployed to the philippines and japan. “that was my band.&& i was crazy about them.&&” he said of ellington and his orchestra.&& a centerpiece of his early swing jazz collection along with benny goodman.&& woody herman and other greats..&& now.&& the 95-year-old is sharing some of the music he collected and curated over the years with the world. smith recently donated 300 of his beloved cds.&& lps and 78s to the internet archive.&& including a mix of classical.&& jazz.&& western swing.&& country.&& folk.&& and blues. a first set of the 78s is now online.&& and the remaining collection is queued for digitization..&& “i thought somebody else should have access and be enjoying them.&&” said smith.&& who lives in austin.&& texas. “i’m just thrilled. i’m the winner here.”.&& view collection.&& when smith was in the hospital earlier this year.&& he talked with his family about what would happen to his music someday. his son.&& mark smith.&& recently retired as director and state librarian at the texas state library and archives commission.&& suggested the internet archive could digitize the items and provide a permanent home..&& “my dad isn’t a big internet guy.&& so i took my computer over and showed him how it would work.&& and how people could listen to his music.&&” said mark. “he was excited and thought it sounded wonderful.” .&& mark then contacted liz rosenberg.&& donations manager at the archive.&& who gave him instructions on how to ship the records and media to the archive. he brought the cds and records to the ups store.&& where they were boxed up and sent. “it worked out great. it was easy.&&” said mark..&& growing up.&& mark says he was more into rock and folk music.&& but he understands how his dad’s generation loved the swing era and admired the musical genius of legends such as ellington.  ben met ellington once at a show in fort worth.&& texas.&& in 1947. after the concert.&& he approached ellington for an autograph.&& but his pen didn’t work. “he was so cordial and in his mellow voice said.&& ‘i have a pen’ and reached into his vest pocket and took out this beautiful pen and wrote his very ornate signature.&&” ben recalls. .&& born in orange.&& texas.&& in 1926.&& ben was a staff artist at the university of texas for 38 years. in his donation to the archive.&& he included an illustration of ellington he drew in the 1940s and a watercolor of longtime ellington alto sax soloist johnny hodges. .&& mark says he’s pleased to have his father’s collection featured alongside other digitized items available to the public..&& “i think the internet archive is one of the coolest things on the whole internet – the wayback machine and all of the spoken word recordings.&& not to mention the vast grateful dead recordings.&&” said mark smith. “i’m very grateful to the archive for taking in my dad’s collection.&& making it available and making my dad very.&& very happy.”.&& looking around your home in the new year and wondering what to do with all the stuff you’ve accumulated? you’re not alone — turns out 54% of americans are overwhelmed by the amount of clutter around them. as people move or downsize.&& they are often in a dilemma about what to do with their beloved books and records. the same goes for colleges and libraries when they close or relocate. so what’s a preservation-minded person or organization supposed to do with their extra books.&& records.&& or other media?.&& the internet archive is here to help! we welcome donations with open arms — from single books to entire libraries. the internet archive seeks to preserve and digitize one copy of every book.&& record.&& cd.&& film.&& and microfilm in support of our mission to provide “universal access to all knowledge.”.&& “increasingly.&& people are turning to the internet archive to preserve materials and give them new life online.&&” said liz rosenberg.&& donation manager. “staff members can even help to arrange for a convenient pick up of larger donations.” .&&  “we are always looking for items that we don’t have already or ones that are in better shape.&&” said rosenberg.&& who encourages people to check online.&& if convenient.&& if a copy is needed. for large collections or donations with special circumstances.&& internet archive will go onsite to pack and ship items at no expense to the donor. “our goal is to make this process easy for donors.”.&& internet archive receives a variety of materials from individuals and organizations. boxes can be mailed to facilities in richmond.&& california.&& or brought to drop off locations in the u.s. and england. the archive tries to digitize materials and make them available publicly.&& as funding allows. .&& recent personal donations have included a collection of railroad maps and atlases from the 1800s. also.&& a large collection of fragile 78rpm records was donated by a person in washington.&& d.c..&& and 18.&&000 lp.&& 45.&& and 78 records were donated from a home in arkansas..&& some recent institutional donations include 80.&&000 books from the evangelical seminary.&& 191 boxes of journals and periodicals from hope international university.&& and 70.&&000 books.&& journals and microfilm from marygrove college. these larger gifts are made into special collections to help internet archive users find the materials and celebrate the donor..&& we are happy to give donors a receipt for tax purposes and celebrate the donation on the archive.org site if appropriate. .&& “we would love to provide a forever home for your media wherever you are located.&& however much you have.&&” said rosenberg. “i love doing this role. it restores my faith in the goodness of the world every day.”.&& for more information about contributing.&& please visit the internet archive help center..&& discogs has cracked the nut.&& struck the right balance.&& and is therefore an absolute internet treasure– thank you..&& if you don’t know them.&& discogs is a central resource for the lp/78/cd music communities.&& and as wikipedia said “as of 28 august 2019 discogs contained over 11.6 million releases.&& by over 6 million artists.&& across over 1.3 million labels.&& contributed from over 456.&&000 contributor user accounts—with these figures constantly growing…”.&& when i met the founder.&& kevin lewandowski.&& a year ago he said the portland based company supports 80 employees and is growing. they make money by being a marketplace for buyers and sellers of discs.  an lp dealer i met in oklahoma sells most of his discs through discogs as well as going at record fairs..&& the data about records is spectacularly clean. compare it to ebay.&& where the data is scattershot.&& and you have something quite different and reusable. it is the best parts of musicbrainz.&& cddb.&& and ebay– where users can catalog their collections and buy/sell records. by starting with the community function.&& kevin said.&& the quality started out really good.&& and then adding the market place later led it to its success..&& but there is something else discogs does that sets it apart from many other commercial websites.&& and this makes all the difference:.&& discogs also makes their data available.&& in bulk.&& and with a free-to-use api..&& the great 78 project has leveraged this bulk database to help find the date of release for 78’s.  just yesterday.&& i downloaded the new dataset and added it to our 78rpm date database.&& and in last year 10’s of thousands more 78’s were added to discogs.&& and we found 1.&&500 more dates for our existing 78’s.   thank you!.&& the internet archive lost vinyl project leverages the api’s by looking up records we will be digitizing to find track listings..&& a donor to our cd project used the public price information to appraise the cds he donated for a tax write-off..&& we want to add links back from discogs to the internet archive and they have not allowed that yet (please please).&& but there is always something more to do..&& i hope other sites.&& even commercial ones.&& would allow bulk access to their data (an api is not enough).   .&& thank you.&& discogs..&& we have been digitizing about 8.&&000 78rpm record sides each month and now have 122.&&000 of them done. these have been posted on the net and over a million people have explored them. we have been digitizing.&& typing the information on the label.&& and linking to other information like discographies.&& databases.&& reviews and the like..&& volunteers.&& users.&& and internal qa checkers have pointing out typos.&& and we decided to go back over a couple of month’s metadata and found problems. and then we contracted with professional proofreaders and they found even more (2% of the records at this point had something to point out.&& some are matters of opinion or aesthetics.&& some lead to corrections)..&& we are going to pay the professional proofreaders to correct the 5 most important fields for all 122.&&000 records.&& but can use more help. we are pointing these out here in hopes to interest volunteer proofreaders and to share our experience in continually improving our collections..&& here are

sides of 78rpm records.&& and we are looking for donations to digitize and physically preserve. we try to do a good job of digitizing and hosting the recordings and then thousands of people listen.&& learn.&& and enjoy these fabulous recordings.  .&& if you have 78s (or other recordings) that you would like to find a good home for.&& please think of us — we are a non-profit and your donations will be tax-deductible.&& digitized for all to hear.&& and physically preserved. if you are interested in donating recordings of any type or appropriate books.&& please start with this form and we will contact you immediately.&& we are looking for anything we do not already have. (we are finding 80% duplication rates sometimes.&& so we are trying to find larger or more niche collections).  we will physically preserve all genres.&& but our current funding has directed us to prioritize digitization of non-classical and non-opera..&& we can pay for packing and shipping.&& and are getting better at the logistics for collections of a few thousand and up.  these are fragile objects and we are having good luck avoiding damage..&& the collections get highlighted and if you submit a story we will post it prominently. for instance: boston public library.&& daniel mcneil and tina argumedo’s argentinian tango collection..&& the reason to highlight the donors is twofold: one is the celebrate the donor and their story.&& but the other is to help contextualize these recordings for different generations. these stories help users find meaning in the materials and find things they want to listen to. this way we can lead new listeners to love this music as the original collectors have.&& working together we can broaden this collection to works from around the world and different cultural groups in each country..&& if you are a private individual or an institution and have records to contribute.&& even if they are not 78s.&& please start with this simple form.&& or email info@archive.org.&& or call +1-415-561-6767 and we will contact you immediately. thank you..&& commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s.&& bringing entertainment.&& news and music into people’s homes. now.&& instead of needing to play a 78rpm disc on your phonograph.&& you could just tune in to listen to popular songs..&& and in 1923 that means you would have been listening to one of the many versions of “yes! we have no bananas” written by frank silver and irving cohn.  .&& you could listen to the billy jones version (play below).&& the billy murray version.&& a yiddish version.&& or an italian version.&& among others..&& then you could have moved on to dancing the charleston.&& popularized by the song of the same name from the 1923 musical “runnin’ wild.”   and with the explosion of recordings by african american musicians.&& you could also enjoy “baby won’t you please come home” by bessie smith and “dipper mouth blues” by louis armstrong..&& in the news of the day you saw the first flight of an autogyro (the precursor to the helicopter)..&& jack dempsey defended his world heavyweight championship title against tommy gibbons and luis firpo..&& and howard carter’s team finally entered the burial chamber of king tutankhamen.&& as covered in books.&& sheet music and song! .&& but why are we focusing on 1923? because for the first time in 20 years.&& new works are entering the public domain in the united states (read more: 1.&& 2.&& 3). and those works were all published in.&& you guessed it.&& 1923..&& settle in with a reese’s peanut butter cup.&& a butterfinger.&& or a refreshing popsicle (all invented in 1923!) while you watch cecil b. demille’s the ten commandments.&& the white sister starring lillian gish.&& or the hunchback of notre dame starring lon chaney. or any one of 50 other films available on archive.org from that year..&& after your movie marathon.&& you can turn to your “new” reading materials to learn about sewing the latest women’s fashions.&& try an old recipe from a cook book (we recommend the marshmallow loaf).&& learn about theatrical lighting.&& construct yourself a bungalow (um.&& check the lastest building codes first).&& grab some sheet music.&& read up on benito mussolini.&& and learn “how you can keep fit” from rudolph valentino (!)..&& finally.&& settle in to read some robert frost.&& virginia woolf.&& edith wharton.&& or kahlil gibran. and while you’re here.&& take a look at the 20.&&000 other texts we have available from 1923. .&& we look forward to introducing you to 1924 next january!.&& jason scott.&& free-range archivist.&& reporting in as 2017 draws to a close..&& as part of our end-of-year fundraising drive.&& i thought it might be fun to tweet highlighted parts of the vast stacks of content that the internet archive makes available for free to millions. a lot of folks know about our wayback machine and its 20+ years of website history.&& but there’s petabytes of media and works available to see throughout the site. i called it “30 days of stuff”.&& and for the last 30 days i’ve been pointing out great items at the archive.&& once a day..&& you won’t have to swim upstream through my tweets; here on the last day.&& i’ve compiled the highlighted items in this entry. enjoy these jewels in the archive’s collection.&& a small sample of the wide range of items we provide..&& .&& books and texts.&& .&& magazines.&& .&& movies.&& .&& audio.&& .&& software.&& people often overuse a phrase like “barely scratched the surface”.&& but i assure you there are millions of amazing items in the archive.&& and it’s been a pleasure to bring some to light. while the 30 days of stuff was a fun way to stretch out a month of fundraising with stuff to see every day.&& we’re here 24/7 to bring you all these items.&& and welcome you finding jewels.&& gems and clunkers throughout our hard drives whenever you want..&& thanks for another year!.&& .&& i believe we can do a fabulous job of bringing the music from the 78rpm era back to vibrant life if we really understand wear and if we could model the instruments and voices..&& in other words.&& i believe we could reconstruct a performance by semantically modeling the noise and distortion we want to get rid of.&& as well as modeling the performer’s instruments..&& to follow this reasoning—what if we knew we were examining a piano piece and knew what notes were being played on what kind of piano and exactly when and how hard for each note—we could take that information to make a reconstruction by playing it again and recording that version. this would be similar to what optical character recognition (ocr) does with images of pages with text—it knows the language and it figures out the words on the page and then makes a new page in a perfect font. in fact.&& with the ocr’ed text.&& you can change the font.&& make it bigger.&& and reflow the page to fit on a different device..&& what if we ocr’ed the music? this might work well for the instrumental accompaniment.&& because then we would handle a voice.&& if any.&& differently. we could have a model of the singer’s voice based on not only this recording and other recordings of this song.&& but also all other recordings of that singer. with those models we could reconstruct the voice without any noise or distortion at all..&& we would balance the reconstructed and the raw signals to maintain the subtle variations that make great performances.   this could also be done for context as sometimes digital filmmakers add in some scratched film effects..&& so.&& there can be a wide variety of restoration tools if we make the jump into semantics and big data analysis..&& the great 78 project will collect and digitize over 400.&&000 digitized 78rpm recordings to make them publicly available.&& creating a rich data set to do large scale analysis. these transfers are being done with four different styli shapes and sizes at the same time.&& and all recorded at 96khz/24bit lossless samples.&& and in stereo (even though the records are in mono.&& this provides more information about the contours of the groove). this means each groove has 8 different high-resolution representations of every 11 microns. furthermore.&& there are often multiple copies of the same recording that would have been stamped and used differently. so.&& modeling the wear on the record and using that to reconstruct what would have been on the master may be possible..&& many important records from the 20th century.&& such as jazz.&& blues.&& and ragtime.&& have only a few performers on each.&& so modeling those performers.&& instruments.&& and performances is quite possible.  analyzing whole corpuses is now easier with modern computers.&& which can provide insights beyond restoration as well as understand playing techniques that are not commonly understood..&& if we build full semantic models of instruments.&& performers.&& and pieces of music.&& we could even create virtual performances that never existed.  imagine a jazz performer virtually playing a song that had not been written in their lifetime. we could have different musician combinations.&& or singers performing with different cadences. areas for experimentation abound once we cross the threshold of full corpus analysis and semantic modeling..&& we hope the technical work done on this project will have a far-reaching effect on a full media type since the great 78 project will digitize and hold a large percentage of all 78rpm records ever produced from 1908 to 1950.  therefore.&& any techniques that are built upon these recordings can be used to restore many many records..&& please dive in and have fun with a great era of music and sound..&&  .&& (we get a sample every 11microns when digitizing the outer rim of a 78rpm record at 96khz.   and given we now have 8 different readings of that.&& with 24bit resolution.&& we hopefully can get a good idea of the groove.   there are optical techniques that are very cool.&& but those have their own issues.&& i am told.&& 10″ * 3.14 = 31.4″ circumference = 80cm/revolution.&& @ 78rpm:  60 seconds/min / 78revolutions/minute = .77 seconds / revolution.&& 80cm/rev   / (.77sec/rev)  = 104cm/sec.&& 96ksampes/sec.&& 104cm/sec / (96ksamples/sec) = 11microns ).&&  .&& .&& by jessica thompson.&& coast mastering.&& the great 78 project a few times a year.&& i join b. george in the internet archives’ warehouses to help sort and pack 78rpm discs to ship to george blood l.p. for digitization. as a music fan and a professional mastering and restoration engineer.&& i get a thrill from handling the heavy.&& grooved discs.&& admiring the fonts and graphic designs on the labels.&& and chuckling at amusing song titles. now digitized.&& these recordings offer a wealth of musicological.&& discographic and technical information.&& documenting and contextualizing music and recording history in the first half of the 20th century..&& the sheer scale of this digitization project is unprecedented. at over 15.&&000 recordings and counting.&& the value strictly in terms of preservation is clear.&& especially given the internet archive’s focus on digitizing music less commonly available to researchers. music fans can take a deep dive into early blues.&& hawaiian.&& hillbilly.&& comedy and bluegrass. i even found several early novachord synthesizer recordings from 1941..&& as a researcher and audio restoration engineer.&& the real goldmine is in the aggregation of discographic and technical metadata accompanying these recordings. historians can search for and cross reference recordings based on label.&& artist.&& song title.&& year of release.&& personnel.&& genre.&& and.&& importantly.&& collection. (the internet archive documents the provenance of the 78rpm discs so that donated collections remain digitally intact and maintain their contextual significance.) general users can submit reviews with notes to amend or add to metadata.&& and the content of those reviews is searchable.&& so metadata collection is active. no doubt it will continue to improve as dedicated and educated users fill in the blanks..&& access to the technical metadata offers a valuable teaching tool to those of us who practice audio preservation. for audio professionals new to 78s and curious about how much difference a few tenths of a millimeter of stylus can make.&& the internet archive offers 15.&&000+ examples of this. play through the different styli options.&& and it quickly becomes apparent that particular labels.&& years and even discs do respond better to specific styli sizes and shapes. this is something audio preservationists are taught.&& but rarely are we presented with comprehensive audio examples. to be able to listen to and analyze the sonic and technical differences in these versions marries the hard science with the aesthetic..&& playback speeds were not standardized until the late 1920s or early 1930s.&& and most discs were originally cut at speeds ranging from 76-80rpm (and some well beyond). the discs in the george blood collection were all digitized at a playback speed of 78rpm. preservationists and collectors debate extensively about the “correct” speed at which discs ought to be played back.&& and whether one ought to pitch discs individually. however.&& performance.&& recording and manufacturing practices varied so widely that even if a base speed could generally be agreed upon.&& there will always be exceptions. (for more on this.&& please check out george blood’s forthcoming paper stylus size and speed selection in pre-1923 acoustic recordings in sustainable audiovisual collections through collaboration: proceedings of the 2016 joint technical symposium. bloomington.&& in: indiana university press.).&& every step of making a recording involves so many aesthetic decisions – choices of instrumentation.&& methods of sound amplification.&& microphone placement.&& the materials used in the disc itself.&& deliberate pitching of the instruments and slowing or speeding of the recording – that playback speed simply become one of many aesthetic choices in the chain. as preservationists.&& we are preserving the disc as an historic record.&& not attempting to restore or recreate a performance. (furthermore.&& speed correction is possible in the digital realm.&& should anyone want to modify these digital files for their own personal enjoyment)..&& how do they sound? each 78rpm disc has an inherent noise fingerprint based on the frequency and dynamic range the format can replicate (limited.&& compared to contemporary digital playback formats) and the addition of surface noise from dust.&& dirt and stylus wear in the grooves. as expected.&& the sound quality in this collection varies. some of these discs were professionally recorded.&& minimally played.&& stored well.&& and play back with a tolerable.&& even ignorable level of surface noise relative to the musical content. others were recorded under less professional circumstances.&& and/or were much loved.&& frequently played.&& stored without sleeves in basements and attics.&& and therefore suffer from significant surface noise that can interfere with enjoyment (and study) of the music..&& yet.&& a compelling recording can cut through noise. take this 1944 recording of josh white performing st. james infirmary.&& asch 358-2a. this side has been released commercially several times.&& so if you look it up on a streaming service like spotify.&& you can listen to different versions sourced from the same recording (though almost certainly not from the same 78rpm disc). they play at different speeds.&& some barely perceptibly faster or slower but at least one nearly a half-step faster than the preservation copy digitized by george blood l.p. they also have a range of noise reduction and remastering aesthetics.&& some subtle and some downright ugly and riddled with digital artifacts. the version on the internet archive offers a benchmark. this is what the recording sounded like on the original 78rpm disc. listen to the bend in the opening guitar notes. that technique cuts through the surface noise and should be preserved and highlighted in any restored version (which is another way of saying that any noise reduction should absolutely not interfere with the attack and decay of those luscious guitar notes)..&& .&& mcgill university professor of culture and technology jonathan sterne wrote a book – the audible past: cultural origins of sound reproduction – that is worth reading for anyone interested in a cultural history of early recording formats.&& including 78s. as sterne says.&& sound fidelity is “ultimately about deciding the values of competing and contending sounds.” so.&& in listening to digital versions of 78s on the internet archive.&& music fans.&& researchers.&& and audio professionals alike engage in a process of renegotiating concepts of acceptable thresholds of noise and what that noise communicates about the circumstances of the recording and its life on a physical disc..&& fortunately.&& our brains are very good at calibrating to accept different ratios of signal to noise.&& and.&& i found.&& the more i listened to 78rpm recordings on the internet archive.&& the less i was bothered by the inherent noise. those of us who grew up on cds or digitally recorded and distributed music are not used to the intrusions of surface noise. however.&& when listening to historic recordings.&& we are able to adjust our expectations and process a level of noise that would be ridiculous in contemporary music formats. (imagine this week’s billboard top 100 chart topper.&& bruno mars’s “that’s what i like.&&” with the high and low end rolled off.&& covered in a sheen of crackles and pops). the fact that these 78rpm recordings sound.&& to us.&& like they were made in the 1920s.&& 1930s.&& 1940s lets them get away with a different scale of fidelity. the very nature of their historicity gets them off the hook..&& in analog form.&& crackles and pops can be mesmerizing.&& almost like the sound of a crackling fire. however.&& once digitized.&& those previously random pops become fixed in time. what may have been enjoyable in analog form becomes a permanent annoyance in digital form. the threshold of acceptable noise levels moves again..&& this means that noise associated with recording carriers such as 78rpm discs is almost always preferably to noises introduced in the digital realm through the process of attempted noise reduction. sound restorationists understand that their job is to follow a sonic hippocratic oath: do no harm. though noise reduction tools are widely available.&& they range in quality (and accordingly in cost).&& and are merely tools to be used with a light or heavy touch.&& by experienced or amateur restorationists..&& the question of whether noise reduction of the internet archive’s 78rpm recordings could be partially automated makes my heart palpitate. though i know from experience that.&& for example.&& auto-declickers exist that could theoretically remove a layer of noise from these recordings with minimal interference with the musical signal.&& i don’t believe the results would be uniformly satisfactory. it is so easy to destroy the aura of a recording with overzealous.&& heavy-handed.&& cheap.&& or simply unnecessary noise reduction. even a gentle touch of an auto-declicker or de-crackler will have widely varying results on different recordings..&& i tried this with a sampling of selections from the /georgeblood/ collection. i chose eleven songs from different genres and years and ran two different.&& high quality auto-declickers (the izotope rx6 advanced multiband declicker and cedar audio’s declick) on the 24bit flac files. the results were uneven. some of the objectively noisier songs.&& such as blind blake’s tampa bound.&& paramount 12442-b.&& benefited from having the most egregious surface noises gently scrubbed..&& .&& tampa bound flat transfer vs tampa bound declicked.&& dehissed and denoised that’s a lot of noise!.&& .&& however.&& a song with a strong musical presence and mild surface noise such as trio schmeed’s yodel cha cha.&& abc-paramount 9660.&& actually suffered more from light auto-declicking because the content of the horns and percussive elements registered to the auto-delicker as aberrations from the meat of the signal and were dulled. a pop presents as an aberration across all frequencies. mapped visually across frequency.&& time and intensity.&& it looks like a spike cutting through the waveform. a snare hit looks similar and is therefore likely to be misinterpreted by an auto-declicker unless the threshold at which the declicker deploys is set very carefully. this difference is why good restorationists earn their pay..&& .&& yodel cha cha flat transfer and denoised. notice the “clicks and pops” have been scrubbed.&& but so has wanted high end content in the music..&& .&&  i am approaching this collection as a listener and music fan.&& as a researcher.&& and as an audio professional.&& three very different modes of listening and interacting with music. in all cases.&& the internet archive 78rpm collection offers massive amounts of music and data to be explored.&& discovered.&& enjoyed.&& studied and utilized. whether you want to listen to early bill monroe tunes.&& crackles.&& pops and all.&& or explore hundreds of recordings of pre-war polkas.&& or analyze the effects of stylus size on 1930s victor discs.&& the internet archive provides the raw materials in digital form and.&& not to be underestimated.&& preserves the original discs too.][internet archive blogs, a blog from the team at archive.org, category archives: music, meet the librarians: alexis rossi, media & access, passing on a musical love letter to the next generation, no book/music/movie (all media) donation too big or small: please donate, discogs thank you!
