[, the md program at harvard medical school comprises two curricular tracks, pathways and health sciences & technology (hst)., watch curriculum overview video, pathways incorporates pedagogical approaches that foster active learning and critical thinking, earlier clinical experience, advanced clinical and basic/population science experiences, and a scholarly project that will allow every student to plan an individual pathway to the md degree., hst is offered jointly by hms and the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) and is oriented toward students with a declared interest in a career in biomedical research or a strong interest and background in physical or molecular science. the hst curriculum is designed to emphasize basic and quantitative understanding of modern biomedical sciences and pathophysiologic processes and a fundamental approach to important concepts in modern biology and biotechnology., harvard medical school’s md track, harvard-mit’s md track, each year, 135 md students are enrolled in the pathways program, and they learn alongside 35 first-year hsdm students in the preclerkship phase. hst enrolls an additional 30 md students who are  committed to becoming physician-scientists. hst’s preclerkship phase is shared between hms and mit, and hst md courses are conducted jointly with medical engineering-medical physics phd students from mit. while the hst track also follows a three-phase curriculum, the first phase is six months longer than pathways to match mit’s semester structure and provide time for intensive research. as a result, the pce phase has two six-month “phase-shifted” admission points: the pathways students enter each fall and the hst students each spring. finally, the extra six months of the pathways post-pce phase allow for three additional required months of basic and population/social science courses, as well as mentored research experiences., md program objectives, md program governance, hms course catalog, combined degrees, please note that the curriculum is undergoing continuous review and improvement and is subject to change at any time., , 25 shattuck street boston, ma 02115,     ][72cd7925dc2edbcd3f41327961f666c0, meded's custom google search, return to campus - information for the hms community, curriculum, learn about the delivery of educational programs during the covid-19 pandemic., overview of the md curriculum -
