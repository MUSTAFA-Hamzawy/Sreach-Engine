[the covid-19 pandemic has been life-changing for people around the globe. as efforts to slow the progress of the virus unfolded in early 2020.&& librarians.&& archivists and others with interest in preserving cultural heritage began considering ways to document the personal.&& societal.&& and systemic impacts of the global pandemic. these collections  included preserving physical.&& digital and web-based information and artifacts for posterity and future research use. .&& in response.&& the internet archive’s archive-it service launched a covid-19 web archiving special campaign starting in april 2020 to allow existing archive-it partners to increase their web archiving capacity or new partners to join to collect covid-19 related content. in all.&& more than 100 organizations took advantage of the covid-19 web archiving special campaign and more than 200 archive-it partner organizations built more than 300 new collections specifically about the global pandemic and its effects on their regions.&& institutions.&& and local communities. from colleges.&& universities.&& and governments documenting their own responses to community-driven initiatives like sonoma county library’s sonoma responds community memory archive.&& a variety of information has been preserved and made available. these collections are critical historical records in and of themselves.&& and when taken in aggregate will allow researchers a comprehensive view into life during the pandemic..&& we have been exploring with partners ways to provide unified access to hundreds of individual covid-related web collections created by archive-it users. when the institute of museum and library services launched the american rescue plan grant program.&& that was part of the broader american rescue plan.&& a $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed into law on march 11.&& we applied and were awarded funding  to build a covid-19 web archive access portal – a dedicated search and discovery access platform for covid-19 web collections from hundreds of institutions.  the covid-19 web archive will allow for browsing and full text search across diverse institutional collections and enable other access methods.&& including making datasets and code notebooks available for data analysis of the aggregate collections by scholars.  this work will support scholars.&& public health officials.&& and the general public in fully understanding the scope and magnitude of our historical moment now and into the future. the covid-19 web archive is unique in that it will provide a unified discovery mechanism to hundreds of aggregated web archive collections built by a diverse group of over 200 libraries from over 40 us states and several other nations.&& from large research libraries to small public libraries to government agencies. if you would like your archive-it collection or a portion of it included in the covid-19 web archive.&& please fill out this interest form by friday.&& april 29.&& 2022. if you are an institution in the united states that has covid-related web archives collected outside of archive-it or internet archive services that you are interested in having included in the covid-19 web archive.&& please contact covidwebarchive@archive.org..&& from her home in wellington city.&& new zealand.&& siobhan leachman is devoted to doing what she can to make it easier for the public to access information about scientific discoveries. in particular.&& she wants to highlight the contributions of women in science..&& leachman is a volunteer wikimedian.&& digital curator.&& and citizen scientist. she uses open content to create open content. her mission in life: to connect everything. and in doing so.&& she relies on the internet archive—and adds to its resources. .&& the wayback machine is vital to leachman’s work.&& which focuses on putting reference citations in wikidata or wikipedia. if she comes across a broken link in her research.&& the wayback machine is her go-to source to recover it. as leachman edits an article and inserts the digital urls.&& she also saves her work through the internet archive for others. .&& “it’s part of my workflow and just takes a couple of minutes.&&” she said of sharing the references she finds with the wayback machine. “it means the information is there in perpetuity. five years down the road.&& what i was using as a reference is still there—rather than worrying about the link disappearing into the ether.”.&& leachman got started as a digital volunteer for the smithsonian transcribing journals. “i just fell in love with doing it.&&” she said. “i’d end up going down these research rabbit holes.&& finding out about the people and i’d want to know more.”  .&& in her research.&& leachman has gravitated to natural history.&& learning about different species and wanting to preserve knowledge about new zealand’s biodiversity. she reviewed diaries of scientists collecting specimens and was spurred to do more research about their lives. .&& leachman uncovered many women who had made contributions.&& but whose stories were not chronicled. one  of the scientists she’s researched is winifred chase.&& an american who participated in a botanical expedition to the south pacific in 1909 with two other women. leachman helped trace lantern slides created by chase on the journey to new zealand.&& which she incorporated into her wikipedia entry on chase’s life..&& to complete the profiles of the scientists she’s researching.&& leachman tracks down information about their lives and work through genealogy sites.&& as well as year books and natural history society journals found in the internet archive and borrowed via her internet archive account. “it’s absolutely thrilling. i love the stories.&&” she said of her research. “it’s as if you are reaching across time.” leachman pieces together details and writes articles about female scientists.&& and in doing so.&& has become an advocate for open access..&& “i’m keen on showing that women have contributed to science forever. it’s just not well documented.&&” said leachman.&& who found many of the subjects she’s covered were amateur botanists or entomologists. “they’ve done a lot of work.&& but it’s like me—unpaid.&& a hobby. but they still contributed to science.”.&& although some did not have university qualifications.&& women played a role over the years.&& said leachman.&& and it’s important they get the recognition they deserve..&& she often links her findings to the biodiversity heritage library.&& a worldwide consortium of natural history.&& botanical.&& research.&& and national libraries working together to digitize the natural history literature held in their collections and make it freely available online. the internet archive partners with bhl and its member libraries by providing digitization.&& storage and access for scanned books..&& closer to home.&& the new zealand national library recently faced a dilemma about what to do with low-circulating physical material it no longer had the space to store. leachman applauded the library’s initial plans to donate 600.&&000 excess books to the internet archive.&& but laments the announcement this week that the donation is on pause. once digitized.&& the books would have been accessible to anyone through controlled digital lending.&& and could have been linked to wikipedia. in leachman’s view.&& the donation and digitization of these books would greatly improve access to the knowledge held within these publications for the benefit of all—not just new zealanders.&& but for the world. she is hopeful that this hiatus will be short-lived and that the national library will soon be sending those books to the internet archive for the good of all..&& added leachman: “the internet archive rocks my world. i just love it. it’s so easy to get what you need. i just think it’s amazing.”.&& the internet has revolutionized everything from how we work to how we play—even how we do our holiday shopping. although there’s a lot of advertising.&& spin.&& and flashy discounts crowding the web.&& there are also hidden gems and common goods. this cyber monday.&& we’re celebrating the original promise of cyberspace: a place where anyone can share knowledge freely..&& from the beginning.&& the internet archive was meant to be a library of everything for the digital age. not only would it be a resource available to the entire world.&& but it would be a step forward into the future—smarter than paper and more accessible than a physical library. for 25 years we’ve been building the our collections.&& with help from our community every step of the way. your support has always been crucial for our work..&& right now we’re in the middle of our end of year fundraising campaign. thanks to a generous anonymous donor.&& all gifts received through december 31.&& 2021 will be matched 2-to-1.&& tripling the impact of your generosity towards this valuable resource. if you find our website useful.&& please consider donating to help us continue to expand and grow..&& the internet archive is home to billions of webpages; millions of books.&& videos.&& audio files.&& and images; and hundreds of thousands of software programs. making that much data freely available to our more than 1.5 million daily users comes with a cost. your donations will ensure that our servers can keep running.&& our storage can grow.&& and our staff can continue to maintain our systems and infrastructure. .&& if you can’t imagine a future without access to our vast collections.&& please make a tax-deductible donation today. big or small.&& we promise to put your donation to good use as we continue to further universal access to all knowledge..&& .&& at the

smith became a huge fan of swing and big-band music — especially the masterful duke ellington.&& known for the classics “mood indigo” and “take the ‘a’ train.” .&& smith started collecting ellington records in 78rpm format in high school and continued during world war ii when he served in the air force stationed in various u.s. cities before being deployed to the philippines and japan. “that was my band.&& i was crazy about them.&&” he said of ellington and his orchestra.&& a centerpiece of his early swing jazz collection along with benny goodman.&& woody herman and other greats..&& now.&& the 95-year-old is sharing some of the music he collected and curated over the years with the world. smith recently donated 300 of his beloved cds.&& lps and 78s to the internet archive.&& including a mix of classical.&& jazz.&& western swing.&& country.&& folk.&& and blues. a first set of the 78s is now online.&& and the remaining collection is queued for digitization..&& “i thought somebody else should have access and be enjoying them.&&” said smith.&& who lives in austin.&& texas. “i’m just thrilled. i’m the winner here.”.&& view collection.&& when smith was in the hospital earlier this year.&& he talked with his family about what would happen to his music someday. his son.&& mark smith.&& recently retired as director and state librarian at the texas state library and archives commission.&& suggested the internet archive could digitize the items and provide a permanent home..&& “my dad isn’t a big internet guy.&& so i took my computer over and showed him how it would work.&& and how people could listen to his music.&&” said mark. “he was excited and thought it sounded wonderful.” .&& mark then contacted liz rosenberg.&& donations manager at the archive.&& who gave him instructions on how to ship the records and media to the archive. he brought the cds and records to the ups store.&& where they were boxed up and sent. “it worked out great. it was easy.&&” said mark..&& growing up.&& mark says he was more into rock and folk music.&& but he understands how his dad’s generation loved the swing era and admired the musical genius of legends such as ellington.  ben met ellington once at a show in fort worth.&& texas.&& in 1947. after the concert.&& he approached ellington for an autograph.&& but his pen didn’t work. “he was so cordial and in his mellow voice said.&& ‘i have a pen’ and reached into his vest pocket and took out this beautiful pen and wrote his very ornate signature.&&” ben recalls. .&& born in orange.&& texas.&& in 1926.&& ben was a staff artist at the university of texas for 38 years. in his donation to the archive.&& he included an illustration of ellington he drew in the 1940s and a watercolor of longtime ellington alto sax soloist johnny hodges. .&& mark says he’s pleased to have his father’s collection featured alongside other digitized items available to the public..&& “i think the internet archive is one of the coolest things on the whole internet – the wayback machine and all of the spoken word recordings.&& not to mention the vast grateful dead recordings.&&” said mark smith. “i’m very grateful to the archive for taking in my dad’s collection.&& making it available and making my dad very.&& very happy.”.&& from texas to virginia to pennsylvania.&& there is a growing movement to challenge books in schools that some suggest are inappropriate for students. concern goes beyond explicit content; it now includes opposition to lgbtqia material.&& the history of racism.&& and material that may cause discomfort to readers..&& while efforts to ban books are not new.&& the solutions to counter censorship are—thanks to technology that is used to create access for all. .&& the internet archive’s open library (https://openlibrary.org) does not face the same local pressures that many school districts or school libraries do. at a time when students and teachers may be encountering limited access to content in their local community.&& the internet archive acquires and digitizes material for its online library.&& and lends a wide array of books for free to anyone.&& anytime..&& for example.&& the american library association’s list of most challenged books in the past decade are available in a curated collection. among the titles: the glass castle by jennette walls.&& banned for offensive language and sexually explicit content; the hunger games by suzanne collins.&& cited as being insensitive.&& anti-family and violent; and beyond magenta: transgender teens speak out by susan kuklin.&& challenged for its lgbtqia content and the perceived effects on young people who would read it. .&& books dealing with gay and trans rights have long been targeted in school libraries. there are more than 1.&&800 titles in open library’s lgbtq collection—sorted.&& searchable and available to borrow online for free. many of the novels.&& memoirs and works of history are not otherwise accessible to people who live in rural areas or places where those materials are explicitly banned. .&& new challenges.&& new responses.&& the new efforts to ban books are taking a much broader view of limiting access. across the country.&& some objectors say books like beloved by toni morrison.&& which was awarded the pulitzer prize for fiction in 1988.&& should not be discussed or available in schools. as these lists are made public.&& open library’s volunteer team of open librarians take action to ensure that these books remain accessible to all..&& recently.&& open library created a collection of books removed from circulation in the goddard school district in kansas. it includes the hate u give by angie thomas and fences by august wilson.&& which was awarded the pulitzer prize for drama in 1987. a small collection of banned books from alaska’s mat-su valley features catch-22 by joseph heller and the great gatsby by f. scott fitgerald..&& open library’s lead community librarian.&& lisa seaberg.&& is curating a collection of 850 books that have recently been challenged in texas. among the books targeted are ones that mention human sexuality.&& sexually transmitted diseases.&& contain material that might make students feel uncomfortable or distressed because of their race or sex or convey that a student.&& by virtue of their race or sex.&& is inherently racist.&& sexist.&& or oppressive. .&& what’s become caught up in this “wide net.&&” said seaberg.&& are books about health education.&& teen pregnancy.&& civics.&& philosophy.&& religion.&& anthropology.&& inventions.&& encyclopedias and.&& ironically.&& a novel about book censorship in a high school. those who favor removing certain books see an opportunity and momentum.&& she said.&& but the difference in this moment is that libraries are able to provide access to titles regardless of where the reader is located. .&& one reason books get banned is because political forces within an area become stronger than the populace.&& said mek.&& who leads the open library team for the internet archive. “open library is trying to bridge these inequity gaps across geographies and social classes. we invite the populace to come together and participate in a digital sanctuary where our rich and diverse cultural heritage isn’t subject to censorship by the few with special interests.”.&& “[t]here’s a difference between sharing an opinion and robbing someone of the opportunity to form their own.”.&& at the most basic level.&& banning books is about restricting access to knowledge.&& said lisa petrides.&& chief executive officer and founder of the institute for the study of knowledge management in education (iskme). .&& “the impact of this on schools means that students are exposed to a limited set of world views.&& which is extremely detrimental to critical thinking.&& reflective analysis and discussion.&&” said petrides. “perhaps even more importantly as we are seeing today.&& this means that educators and librarians are increasingly put in difficult situations.&& having to face the threat of reprisal from administrators or school boards.&& who are themselves increasingly less willing to stand up for the first amendment rights of their teachers and learners.”   .&& the path forward.&& everyone’s perspectives should matter and be represented in the democratic process. a library must offer diverse materials so people can draw their own conclusions.&& said mek.  he embraces the oft-cited quote from librarian jo godwin: “a truly great library contains something in it to offend everyone.”.&& “it’s important for informed members of society to share their opinions.&&” he says. “but there’s a difference between sharing an opinion and robbing someone of the opportunity to form their own. to change hearts and minds.&& write a compelling book—don’t take authors you disagree with off the shelves. the open library community is honoring these values by giving contested titles their spots back on the shelf.”.&& seaberg says.&& hopefully.&& recent book challenges will ultimately fail and access to a range of books will be restored. “if students walk into a library and they have books that only present one side of an issue.&& or are only relatable to a certain group in a culture.&& it excludes a lot of people.&&” she says. “they might not even know this other content exists.”.&& you can browse a full list of open library’s curated collections here. to volunteer for open library and help curate collections.&& please visit

potential of digitizing the world’s knowledge..&& one of those pioneers was carnegie mellon professor raj reddy. the internet archive recently hosted a virtual event to honor him and celebrate the 20th anniversary of his million book project that included reddy.&& vint cerf of google.&& moriel schottlender of the wikimedia foundation.&& brewster kahle of the internet archive.&& mike furlough of haithitrust.&& and liz ridolfo of the university of toronto..&& since reddy’s dream of providing universal access to all human knowledge—instantly to anyone.&& anywhere in the world—others have embraced the mission.  advocates of mass digitization discussed the tremendous impact that open access to creative works online has had on society.&& the challenges ahead.&& and potential.&& if more books are unleashed..&& “there are tens of millions of digitized books available on the internet now. many of these are born digital. many more are being converted from print copies.&&” said mike furlough.&& executive director at hathitrust.&& which has a collection of 17.5 million digital books. “this is really a human accomplishment that represents decades.&& if not centuries.&& of intellectual labor.&& physical labor to steward and preserve these items.”.&& reddy said he knew his vision two decades ago was just the beginning and there is a huge amount of room to improve the utility of digital works. “it’s time for us to put our heads together to find a way to create digital libraries and archives that are far more useful than what we have today.&&” he said..&& many agreed more must be done to expand efforts.&& build a sustainable infrastructure and raise awareness of the shifting role of libraries to provide digital materials..&& “i think we should ask more questions: what aren’t we digitizing? what are the economic or political forces that are constraining our choices and what corrective measures can we take?”.&& internet archive founder brewster kahle said reddy was right that bringing our full history online for the next generation is important.&& but it’s not been easy technically or institutionally..&& “if we’ve ever wondered why you’d want digital books.&& the year 2020 told us why. the global pandemic hit and shut down school libraries.&& public libraries.&& and college libraries.&&” kahle said. “we got calls from professors.&& teachers and homeschoolers.&& desperate to find some way in their zoom classrooms to bring books to kids.”.&& the internet archive responded.&& explaining how libraries could extend access digitally to books that were in their physical collections. this helped make a big difference on the ground.&& and kahle says policies are changing so libraries are confident in serving their digital learners. for instance.&& as libraries spend $12 billion a year on materials.&& kahle said they should be able to purchase (not lease) e-books to fulfill their mission of service to users..&& there was also a push among panelists for digitization to be more inclusive of works from all kinds of authors.&& recognizing what is being scanned is what’s already been obtained by libraries. “i think we should ask more questions: what aren’t we digitizing? what are the economic or political forces that are constraining our choices and what corrective measures can we take?” furlough said..&& the future interaction with knowledge involves the digitization of books and expanding the diversity of voices is critical.&& said moriel schottlender.&& principal system architect with the wikimedia foundation..&& “making resources available to anyone online is key and this is really what we’re striving for.&&” said schottlender.&& noting wikipedia’s mission is to be a beacon of factual information that is verifiable.&& neutral and transparent. “our goal is that everyone in the world should be able to contribute to the sum of all knowledge. but not everyone has equal access to knowledge.&& to books.&& to journals.&& to libraries.&& to educational materials…we use digitization to increase equity.”.&& “our goal is that everyone in the world should be able to contribute to the sum of all knowledge. but not everyone has equal access to knowledge…we use digitization to increase equity.”.&& .&& there is growing demand for all kinds of digital information.&& said liz ridolfo.&& special collections projects librarian at university of toronto libraries.. donors want items digitized for a variety of reasons including to protect rare items.&& to reach a broader audience.&& and to free up physical space for other materials. especially during the pandemic.&& ridolfo said.&& it has been useful to have a curated collection of online teaching and reference materials..&& vint cerf.&& vice president and internet evangelist at google.&& said people are increasingly going online to get answers to questions—often turning to youtube to view how-to videos. that demand for “just-in-time learning” is not a substitute for long-form content.&& he said.&& but it’s an interesting phenomenon that may draw people to the internet to learn more..&& looking ahead.&& reddy said there is a need for big change to address the broken copyright law. his aspiration is that by 2031.&& there will be a frictionless.&& streamlined copyright regime.&& in which authors register for no fee.&& but can extend the copyright of a work indefinitely if they want by paying a prescribed fee. for users.&& he proposes access to copyright material for fair use in less than five minutes. they could pay a required fee.&& as prescribed by the data for a single copy use. if the copyright is not registered with the national digital library.&& then fines for copyright violations of unregistered copyright material should be nominal..&& “let’s take raj’s vision here and make it come true.&&” kahle said. “who should argue against the streamline system where fair uses are easy. where compensation is understood.&& where there’s registration and the actual copyrighted materials are in repositories that are long-term protected. let’s just do this.”.&& earlier this summer.&& the internet archive announced its partnership with the new york art resources consortium (nyarc) to form a collaborative.&& web-based art resources preservation and access initiative. we are now thrilled

throughout the united states and canada committed to the preservation of 21st century art historical resources on the web. one of our early supporters and current carta member amelia nelson.&& director of library and archives at the nelson-atkins museum of art.&& noted the increased risk of losing art history on the web in comparison to earlier generations of artists: “websites are the letters.&& exhibition postcards.&& exhibition reviews and newspaper articles of today’s artists and artistic communities.&& but they aren’t resources that scholars can find in archives like the physical materials that document the careers of earlier generations of artists. i worry that as we lose these sites.&& we are also losing the potential for scholars to place this moment in the canon of art history and culture broadly. this initiative will build a collaborative and sustainable way for art libraries to pool their limited resources.&& with the technical.&& administrative.&& and organizational expertise of the internet archive.&& to ensure that this content is available for future generations.”.&& the initial group of member institutions have identified an initial set of more than 150 valuable and at-risk websites.&& articles.&& and other materials on five primary collection topics: local arts organizations; artists websites; art galleries; auction houses (catalogs/price lists); and art criticism.  these collections will continue to grow and evolve over the course of the project.&& capturing thousands of websites and many terabytes of data. .&& we’re actively seeking more us-based arts institutions to participate in the project as we continue to grow our collections of web-based art history resources. collaborative members attend meetings every two months to
