of data about the http/https requests that are sent to the secure cloudflare proxy via the edge secure network. the data cloudflare processes for the secure network is subject to the microsoft privacy

consultation with microsoft, exhaust its legal remedies before complying with such a request. cloudflare also commits to documenting any government request to block access in its semi-annual transparency report, unless legally prohibited from doing so.     , to provide access, we store minimal support data and access tokens which are only retained for the duration of the required service window., a microsoft account is required to access microsoft edge secure network and is retained to keep track of the amount of microsoft edge secure network data that is used each month. this data
