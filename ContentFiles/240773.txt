presidency. the story was picked up by at least two russian media outlets. however, there is no evidence zelensky is a russian citizen. the image of the passport is fake and the photo of zelensky was

epacopyright: epa the eu can replace russian fossil fuels with supplies from other countries, switching to clean power and by saving energy, european commission president ursula von der leyen says. the eu will provide nearly €300bn to help europe move away from russian energy - about €72bn in grants and €225bn in loans, she says. the investments will include €10bn for gas infrastructure, €2bn for oil, and the rest for clean energy, von der leyen says. the commission is proposing raising its target for energy from renewable sources by 2030 from 40% to 45%, von der leyen adds. she also proposes providing up to €9bn in further aid to ukraine this year. von der leyen also says it is time to think about rebuilding ukraine whenever the war ends, adding the eu has a strategic interest in leading this reconstruction effort but that it should not be the only contributing party. that is why we propose a reconstruction platform as part of this plan jointly led by ukraine and the commission and bringing together eu member states, other bilateral or international donors, international financial institutions, and other like-minded partners, she says. article share tools facebook

shishimarin, who is a very young looking 21-year-old, was brought into the room in handcuffs by heavily armed guards. he looked nervous and often kept his headed bowed, listening intently to his translator through the glass. just a couple of metres from him, the widow of the man he killed was sitting. as the accused soldier entered court, she wiped tears from her eyes, then sat with hands clasped as the prosecutor set out his case, describing the moment kateryna’s husband was shot in the head. and for the first time, she heard the russian soldier admit to the murder. do you accept your guilt, the judge asked. yes, shishimarin replied. totally? yes, he replied quietly in his grey metal and glass cage. the trial has been adjourned until tomorrow so that a bigger courtroom can be found. article share tools facebook twitter shareview more share options share this post copy this linkread more about these links., facebook, twitter, shareview more share options share this post

leader aleksander lukashenko has signed a bill broadening the scope of the death penalty to include attempted acts of terrorism. when vladimir putin launched his ukraine invasion, belarus was a critical element, providing a springboard for a lightning assault on the capital kyiv. but one thing he didnt count on was rail sabotage. from the word go, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disrupt railway links, wreaking havoc on russian supply lines. many russian troops were left stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition. now, alleged saboteurs in belarus could face the firing squad, while the same law will apply to activists who organised the anti-lukashenko protests a couple of years ago. article

applications were turning now to finland and swedens applications for nato membership - and turkeys objections to them joining the alliance. president erdogan said this morning that he expects nato allies to understand turkeys sensitivities about security. in a speech to lawmakers from his ruling party, he also repeated his view that swedish and finnish delegations should not bother coming to turkey to discuss the issues. and he said sweden should not expect turkey to approve its nato membership bid without returning terrorists. turkey accuses the two nordic nations of harbouring members of the kurdistan workers party (pkk), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of fethullah gulen, who ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. according to the official turkish news agency, both finland and sweden have rejected dozens of requests to extradite kurdish militants who turkey describes as terrorists. without the support of all nato members, sweden and finland cannot join the military alliance, although us president joe biden said yesterday he was confident consensus could be reached. article share tools facebook twitter shareview more share options
