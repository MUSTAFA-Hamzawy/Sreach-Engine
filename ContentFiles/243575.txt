[stack overflow for teams “takes off like wildfire” for microsoft’s 50.&&000+ developers.&& resulting in a ripple effect out from internal questions to customer-facing support..&& microsoft is one of the world’s largest and most well respected technology companies. but even after four decades in business.&& the firm continues to evolve. “microsoft in 2014 began a cultural transformation.&& really one from a culture of knowing to one of learning.&&” says ryan j salva.&& a director of product management for the company’s developer services division. “how are we collaborating internally? how are we facilitating better conversations among our developers.&& product teams.&& and sales field?”.&& there are more than 50.&&000 developers working at microsoft. until recently.&& conversations and questions about products and services happened over email or group chat. “any email that was sent to a discussion group or a distribution list would get archived in this one place.&&” says laura macleod.&& a program manager in the developer services division. “the challenge with that was that it wasnt discoverable. it wasnt easy for users to find that existing information.”.&& because it was difficult to know if a great answer already existed.&& support teams were often left putting out the same fires over and over again. “we struggled for the longest time with our internal knowledge management.&&” said daniel stefaniak.&& a program manager with an azure ready product group. “people kept falling back to email and direct messages.” when the team analyzed the data.&& they were shocked. “the same question was being asked three times a month and about 70% of questions were left unanswered.”.&& “when microsoft as a whole was looking in the mirror and self-evaluating.&& one of the things that we found was that communication itself was pretty inefficient.&&” says salva. “we did have an internal q&a system.&& but it only had about 900 users.”.&& so starting in 2016.&& his team began searching for a different solution. “we set about the job of trying to better understand how developers and product teams would like to communicate. there were three key points that teams needed.&& says salva. first.&& we needed easy onboarding. we also needed well structured content. last but not least.&& we needed a really low friction way to create the content.”.&& what microsoft discovered was that many of their developers were using the same tool to manage knowledge around code.&& just not internally. “while microsoft often creates tools for problems that we see unsolved.&& we saw that this was a problem that has already been solved.&& and solved well with stack overflow.&&” says salva. “we approached stack overflow to have a conversation about how we could create an enterprise organizational community of questions and answers that could service our internal teams. just two and a half years later.&& we have over 70.&&000 users asking 80.&&000 questions.”.&& macleod was one of the internal stakeholders charged with trying to build an engaged community around stack overflow inside of microsoft. luckily.&& the software developers who made up the bulk of early users were very familiar with stack overflow.&& as most used the public site on a regular basis. “when new users join.&& they come in.&& and from day one they know how to use this tool.&&” says macleod. “when we launched our internal stack overflow instance at microsoft.&& it took off like wildfire.”.&& these changes resulted in a major boost to productivity. “historically.&& people are used to finding distribution lists and sending questions to these distribution lists. they would end up getting answered by other people.&& but there is not historical storage of this data and reuse of data.&& which means that when somebody in the team makes an investment in answering a question.&& it does not get reused at all.&&” says suraj gupta.&& a program manager with the cloud test team. “when these questions are on stack overflow.&& i get to be more productive because i dont have to answer the same question twice.”.&& the impact has quickly rippled out from internal questions to customer facing support. “our colleagues at microsoft are some of the early adopters of our identity technology.&&” says barbara seldon.&& who works on knowledge management for the microsoft identity team. “by answering their questions.&& we get a heads up on the needs of our customers around the world.&& and were able to take the output from their questions.&& analyze the root cause.&& and then update our external facing documentation or create new documentation. and by doing that.&& working with our internal colleagues and answering their questions actually benefits all of the users of identity around the world.”.&& stefaniak sees the change in the support work he does every day. “it feels like repeat questions do not happen anymore.&&” and a much smaller percentage of questions go unanswered. “collectively.&& there has been a great sigh of relief.”.&& initially.&& stack overflow was used internally at microsoft only by employees working directly on creating software or supporting clients using that software. but as word spread about this new tool.&& it quickly became clear that this kind of q&a wasn’t just for helping programmers resolve an error message..&& the platform also began to spread to employees who didn’t work directly on building software. “it’s been a resource for our entire company.&&” says salva. “not only for developers to solve problems.&& it’s also enabled ours sales field to answer technical questions that help them close deals. it’s permeated the company in every way.&&”.&& salva believes that the internal changes driven by stack overflow ultimately have a positive impact on public consumers. “a lot of what i do is help those teams think about how they can collaborate more effectively.&& how they can bring their teams together and sharing information and sharing processes.&& systems.&& and methodologies.&&” says salva. “stack overflow is not only a means to an end for users who are eager to find a quick answer to accomplish some task.&& but it’s also a way for our product managers and engineering teams to suss out where we can do more to solve problems in an intuitive way and ultimately deliver a better user experience.”.&& trusted by top fortune 100 companies.&& stack overflow for teams delivers real value for large organizations.][microsoft institutes a “cultural transformation”, using stack overflow
