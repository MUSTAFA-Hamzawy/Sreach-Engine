[notes for cbse class 8 mathematics concepts, helps to understand all the concepts of class 8 maths in a chapter-wise manner as it covers all the topics and subtopics provided in the syllabus of class 8 maths. the following chapter-wise notes provided by geeksforgeeks are equipped with various shortcut techniques and step-by-step methods in order to understand and solve the problems in a better way., , any number that can be described in p/q form where q is not equal to zero is called a rational number. a rational number is a kind of real number. or in other words, any fraction with non-zero denominators is a rational number., , the linear equation in one variable is an expression that is denoted as ax+b = 0, where a and b are any two integers, and x is a variable and consists of only one solution., , geometrically, a quadrilateral is defined as a closed, 2-d shape that has four linear sides. the different types of quadrilaterals according to their number of edges and vertices are square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezium, kite, rhombus., , the chapter practical geometry simply means is to construct geometrical figures like squares, triangles, quadrilateral, etc. using a scale, and compass when different parameters of it are known. , , data handling refers to the process of collecting, organizing, and presenting any raw information in a way that is helpful to others like in graphs or charts, etc., , both the concepts of squares and square roots are opposite to each other. as the squares are used for the numbers come after multiplying the number by itself. however, the square root of a number is the value obtained when multiplied by itself to give the original value. for instance, the square of 5 is 25 and the square root of 25 is 5., , again both the concepts of cubes and cube roots are opposite to each other. as the cubes are used for the numbers come after multiplying the number by itself thrice. however, the cube root of a number is the value obtained when multiplied by itself thrice to give the original value. for instance, the cube of 5 is 125 and the cube root of 125 is 5., , the chapter comparing quantities is the most basic everyday-life application of mathematics that deals with quantities. this includes the concepts like percentage, ratio, market price, selling price, cost price, discount and discount price, profit or loss, interest, etc. , , the chapter algebraic expressions and identities provides information about the basics of monomials, binomials, and polynomials in an algebraic expression. , , visualizing solid shapes is a concept that provides the understanding of different solids shapes when visualized in different dimensions and various terms used to describe their properties., , mensuration is the chapter that deals with the measurement or the calculations related to determining the area, perimeter, volume of various geometrical figures like square, cube, rectangle, cuboid, cylinder, and triangle, etc. , , the chapter exponents and powers cover the primary concepts such as laws of exponents and their applications. the chapter deals with the problems using the applications of power to write large numbers in exponents and vice-versa., , this chapter gives a detailed explanation of inverse and direct proportions through problems discussed in two exercises. in which exercise 13.1 contains a problem to determine the direct proportions between any quantity and exercise 13.2 deals with the questions from the indirect inverse., , this chapter comprises the problems on the factors of natural numbers and algebraic expressions, factorization by regrouping terms, factorization using identities, division of algebraic expressions. , , this chapter is all about the basic understanding of the graphs, kinds of graphs, etc. lately, this chapter provided an emphasis on the construction of different types of graphs and their applications., , all the above-mentioned chapters basically helped to learn about various kinds of numbers and their different properties likewise in this chapter the concept of numbers is discussed in a more general way. , writing code in
