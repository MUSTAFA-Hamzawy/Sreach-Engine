convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us..&& this policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy.&& how to send us vulnerability reports.&& and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities..&& we want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities theyve discovered – as set out in this policy – so we can fix them and keep our users safe. we have developed this policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share
