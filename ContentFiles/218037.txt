of errors, you may want to look at your logs to identify what is causing your endpoint to crash or behave unexpectedly., action latency: the latency of your action's endpoint. if latency is very high or regularly spikes, your users may be experiencing delays while interacting with your action., latency experienced by user: the latency felt by a user on each request to your action. this metric

includes the following values:, intent: the intent the user’s query matched., impression: the number of times this phrase led to google recommending your action., selection: the number of times a user invoked your action after google recommended it. this number cannot exceed the number of impressions this phrase has., selection rate: the percentage of impressions that led to a selection. a low percent rate indicates that many users are opting to use other actions for this particular query, whereas a high rate indicates that your action is popular for this query., you can export data from the charts in csv format. to do so, click the export button., the directory section shows traffic and ratings for your action in the assistant directory., , bigquery is google's fully managed, serverless data warehousing solution. you can set up your action's analytics data to be exported daily to your bigquery account. once your data is in bigquery, you can perform additional analysis on the data, including building your own dashboards and data visualization., to connect your action to bigquery, follow these steps:, choose the date from when you want to start exporting., , click export., a summary page will show the daily status of the export process as pending, failed, or completed., the export process will show as pending until exporting is completed., to export data from

this data helps you identify opportunities to improve the long term success of your actions. to let you obtain this data, we've let analytics tools providers integrate with actions on google, and you can set up these tools in as little as five minutes:, as you develop and deploy your actions, you might benefit from adding logging, monitoring, and alerting. monitoring and alerting tools track uptime and notify you of errors and exceptions. with these tools, you can also debug and test actions with real requests from the assistant. the following monitoring tools have integrated with actions
