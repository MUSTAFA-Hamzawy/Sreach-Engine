virtual-machine placement, daos: data access-aware operating system seongjae park, madhuparna bhowmik, alexandru uta hpdc 2022 2022 in data-intensive workloads, data placement and memory management are inherently difficult: the programmer and the operating system have to choose between (combinations of) dram and storage, replacement policies, as well as paging sizes. efficient memory management is based on fine-grained data access patterns driving placement decisions. current solutions in this space cannot be applied to general workloads cloud and systems, computation reuse via fusion in amazon athena nicolas bruno, johnny debrodt, chujun song, wei zheng international conference on data engineering (icde 2022) 2022 amazon athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows efficiently analyzing large volumes of data stored in amazon s3 using ansi sql. some design choices in the engine, especially those concerning streaming of intermediate results, can result in suboptimal executions for query patterns that have common expressions. in this paper we build upon recent work and introduce new optimizations in cloud and systems, federated learning challenges and opportunities: an outlook jie ding, eric tramel, anit kumar sahu, shuang wu, salman avestimehr, tao zhang icassp 2022 2022 federated learning (fl) has been developed as a promising framework to leverage the resources of edge devices, enhance customers’ privacy, comply with regulations, and reduce development costs. although many methods and applications have been developed for fl, several critical challenges for practical fl systems remain unaddressed. this paper provides an outlook on fl development as part of the icassp 2022 cloud and systems, dietcode: automatic optimization for dynamic tensor program bojian zheng, ziheng jiang, cody hao yu, haichen shen, josh fromm, yizhi liu, yida wang, luis ceze, tianqi chen, gennady pekhimenko mlsys 2022 2022 achieving high performance for compute-intensive operators in machine learning (ml) workloads is a crucial but challenging task. many ml and system practitioners rely on vendor libraries or auto-schedulers to do the job. while the former requires large engineering efforts, the latter only supports static-shape workloads in existing works. it is difficult, if not impractical, to apply existing auto-schedulers cloud and systems, adaptive load balancing for parallel gnn training qidong su, minjie wang, da zheng, zheng zhang mlsys 2021 workshop: neural networks and systems 2021 the recent emergence of demand for running graph neural networks (gnns) on giant real world graphs requires more scalable system designs. due to the sparse and irregular connections a graph has, parallel gnn training encounters the problem of load imbalance among workers. in this paper, we show that previous techniques based on graph partitioning is insufficient to address the load imbalance caused by gnn cloud and systems, new method for "editing" fabricated chips enables more-efficient designs or haimson april 12, 2022 reducing the energy of ion beams used for editing eliminates the need for “sacrificial” areas between electrical components and improves precision. cloud and systems, scalable framework lets multiple text-to-speech models coexist rafal sienkiewicz, raahil shah april 04, 2022 thanks to a set of simple
