or and then i laughed..&& and perhaps my favorite of the bunch is fido is a hot dog now which seems to be about a dog who is definitely going to hell..&& as usual.&& we are also welcoming some new books.&& movies.&& journals.&& and sheet music – this time from 1926! (read about 1925.&& 1924.&& and 1923 in previous posts.).&& some popular first edition books from 1926:.&& other interesting books from 1926 that you might want to explore include show boat by edna ferber which was made into the musical show boat in 1927 with music by jerome kern.&& the clothes we wear by frank and frances carpenter which is a child friendly exploration of how clothes are made all the way from the field through weaving and into sewing.&& or the art of kissing by clement wood which is pretty self explanatory..&& we invite you to explore some of the other items dated 1926 in our collections to find your own fun items that may now be in the public domain..&& please join us for a virtual party on january 20.&& 2022 at 1pm pacific/4pm eastern time with a keynote from senator ron wyden.&& champion of the music modernization act and a bunch of musical acts.&& dancers.&& historians.&& librarians.&& academics.&& activists and other leaders from the open world!

students in his intro to writing arts class to learn about multimodal composition.&& he has them go to the internet archive for inspiration..&& students peruse 78rpm records going back to the early 20th century to find just the right one for their assignment. there is no lack of material with more than 300.&&000 recordings  from 1898 through the 1950s preserved. they are available to the public because of the collaborative great 78 project..&& although the students are enrolled at rowan university in new jersey.&& many are participating remotely from their homes this year because of the pandemic.&& and the materials are conveniently available digitally to them from anywhere..&& “if the [great 78 project] didn’t exist.&& i don’t think i would have this curriculum at all.&&” said luther.&& assistant professor for writing arts in the ric edelman college of communication & creative arts at rowan. “what i really like is the research challenge. it’s really powerful. so many times students have recovered the lost histories of these songs.”.&& for the phono project.&& rowan students create podcasts and social media posts about recordings in the archive’s 78s collection. they also tap into primary sources on the archive to write the history of the songs. they can write about the stories behind songs like the billie holiday classic “god bless the child.&&” or john lee hooker’s “boogie chillen” from 1948. many gravitate to artists like elvis presley or frank sinatra.&& but luther tries to get them to branch out—especially now that there are more than 200 stories in the project’s collection..&& luther developed the project in 2018 as part of the “technologies and future of writing” module in the writing course. students have just eight classes to complete the 1-3 minute podcasts.&& in which they learn to master a mix of audio tools and editing skills using audacity and wordpress. the course covers issues of compatibility and ownership.&& along with instruction on the economy of writing like a critic about lyrics and culture. for one recent class session.&& he invited liz rosenberg of the archive to be a guest speaker and talk about the organization’s work and the great 78 project..&& in the future.&& luther said he would like to find more ways to incorporate some of the archive’s collection into his curriculum. for instance.&& he may have students use primary source documents from independent publishers over time to craft something tangible.&& such as an actual history from those materials that could be passed along. “that’s one of the neat things about accretion.&&” he said. “we have the creativity.&& but then there’s also documents on the archive that are helping us understand the 78s themselves. it’s such a vast resource.”.&& visit the phono project..&& ***.&& incorporating materials from the internet archive into your course curriculum is easy. each semester we hear from instructors doing so worldwide. let us know how you are weaving internet archive media into your classes by writing to us at info@archive.org..&& radio remains one of the most-consumed forms of traditional media today.&& with 89% of americans listening to radio at least once a week as of 2018.&& a number that is actually increasing during the pandemic. news is the most popular radio format and 60% of americans trust radio news to “deliver timely information about the current covid-19 outbreak.”.&& local talk radio is home to a diverse assortment of personality-driven programming that offers unique insights into the concerns and interests of citizens across the nation. yet radio has remained stubbornly inaccessible to scholars due to the technical challenges of monitoring and transcribing broadcast speech at scale..&& debuting this past july.&& the internet archive’s radio archive uses automatic speech recognition technology to transcribe this vast collection of daily news and talk radio programming into searchable text dating back to 2016.&& and continues to archive and transcribe a selection of stations through present.&& making them browsable and keyword searchable..&& building on this incredible archive.&& the gdelt project and i have transformed this massive archive into a research dataset of radio news ngrams spanning 26 billion english language words across portions of 550 stations.&& from 2016 to the present..&& you can keyword search all 3 million shows.&& but for researchers interested in diving into the deeper linguistic patterns of radio news.&& the new ngrams dataset includes 1-5grams at 10 minute resolution covering all four years and updated every 30 minutes. for those less familiar with the concept of “ngrams.&&” they are word frequency tables in which the transcript of each broadcast is broken into words and for each 10 minute block of airtime a list is compiled of all of the words spoken in those 10 minutes for each station and how many times each word was mentioned..&& how can researchers use this kind of data to understand new insights into radio news?.&& the graph below looks at pronoun usage on bbc radio 4 fm.&& comparing the percentage of words spoken each day that were either (“we”.&& “us”.&& “our”.&& “ours”.&& “ourselves”) or (“i”.&& “me”.&& “i’m”). “me” words are used more than twice as often as “we” words but look closely at february of 2020 as the pandemic began sweeping the world and “we” words start increasing as governments began adopting language to emphasize togetherness..&& combined with the television news ngrams that i previously created.&& it is possible to compare how topics are being covered across television and radio..&& the graph below compares the percentage of spoken words that mentioned covid-19 since the start of this year across bbc news london (television) versus radio programming on bbc world service (international focus) and bbc radio 4 fm (domestic focus)..&& all three show double surges at the start of the year as the pandemic swept across the world.&& a peak in early april and then a decrease since. yet bbc radio 4 appears to have mentioned the pandemic far less than the internationally-focused bbc world service.&& though the two are now roughly equal even as the pandemic has continued to spread. over all.&& television news has emphasized covid-19 more than radio.  .&& for now.&& you can download the entire dataset to explore on your own computer but there will also be an interactive visualization and analysis interface available sometime in mid-spring..&& it is important to remember that these transcripts are generated through computer speech recognition.&& so are imperfect transcriptions that do not properly recognize all words or names.&& especially rare or novel terms like “covid-19.&&” so experimentation may be required to yield the best results..&& the graphs above just barely scratch the surface of the kinds of questions that can now be explored through the new radio news ngrams.&& especially when coupled with television news and 152-language online news ngrams..&& from transcribing 3 million radio broadcasts into ngrams to describing a decade of television news frame by frame.&& cataloging the objects and activities of half a billion online news images.&& to inventorying the tens of billions of entities and relationships in half a decade of online journalism.&& it is becoming increasingly possible to perform multimodal analysis at the scale of entire archives..&& researchers can ask questions that for the first time simultaneously look across audio.&& video.&& imagery and text to understand how ideas.&& narratives.&& beliefs and emotions diffuse across mediums and through the global news ecosystem. helping to seed the future of such at-scale research.&& the internet archive and gdelt are collaborating with a growing number of media archives and researchers through the newly formed media data research consortium to better understand how critical public health messaging is meeting the challenges of our current global pandemic..&& for more than 25 years.&& gdelt’s creator.&& dr. kalev h. leetaru.&& has been studying the web and building systems to interact with and understand the way it is reshaping our global society. one of foreign policy magazine’s top 100 global thinkers of 2013.&& his work has been featured in the presses of over 100 nations and fundamentally changed how we think about information at scale and how the “big data” revolution is changing our ability to understand our global collective consciousness..&& on january 1st.&& 2021.&& many books.&& movies and other media from 1925 will enter the public domain in the united states. some of them are quite famous — jump ahead to see lists of those well known books and movies that you can enjoy on the internet archive — or take the scenic route with me..&& what does this all mean? essentially.&& many items created in 1925 in the us that are still under copyright will become free and open for people to use in any way they see fit in the new year. but check out duke law’s center for the study of the public domain article for a more in-depth explanation..&& we have a party every year to celebrate the new works entering the public domain.&& and this year is no exception. join us on thursday.&& dec. 17th to toast these newly available additions..&& as part of this yearly ritual.&& i explore our collections to unearth these newly freed items.&& and i invariably run across a few things that hit a nerve. this year.&& it started with this intertitle in “isn’t life terrible?” less than 20 seconds into this 1925 film.&& and suddenly i’m dumped back into 2020..&& rude.&& right? i don’t even have a front yard to enjoy during shelter in place..&& but the magic of media is that it can transport us to different places and times. photo books like picturesque italy.&& picturesque mexico.&& and picturesque palestine.&& arabia and syria show us both how much and how little has changed in the past 95 years..&& gondolas still glide under the bridge of sighs.&& and the tower of pisa is still leaning.&& but the 1925 version of the colosseum certainly lacks today’s fake gladiator photo ops..&& every toe dipped into the past has the potential to surprise or shock. the story of a pantry shelf.&& an outline history of grocery specialties is only mildly interesting on the surface. essentially.&& it’s a sales pitch to food manufacturers encouraging them to advertise in a set of women’s magazines. the book contains short case histories of successful food brands like maxwell house coffee.&& campbell soup.&& coca cola.&& etc. (all of whom advertise with them.&& naturally)..&& the book gives you a glimpse of why people were so enthusiastic about mass produced.&& packaged foods. unsanitary conditions.&& bugs in your sugar.&& milk going bad over night; things modern shoppers never think about..&& it puts this glowing praise of kraft cheese into perspective: “…a pasteurized product.&& blended to obtain a uniformity of quality and flavor.&& a thing greatly lacking in ordinary types of cheese.” (page 149).&& that’s pretty entertaining if you’re a cheese lover. i think most people would agree that kraft cheese is no longer on the cutting edge..&& but keep poking around and you find a much deeper cultural divergence. while the story of a pantry shelf is extolling the virtues of the home economics training available at cornell.&& you stumble across this horrifying sentence (page 12)..&& i was not expecting to read about orphaned babies being used as “learning aids” while flipping through stories about jell-o. intellectually.&& i know that attitudes towards children have changed over the years — the fair labor standards act.&& which set federal standards for child labor.&& wasn’t even passed until 1938. but this casual aside tossed in amongst the marketing hype still packs an emotional punch. it’s important to remember how far we have come..&& even writing that was forward-thinking for the time.&& like the booklet homo-sexual life.&& is terribly backward according to today’s standards. it’s from the little blue book series — we have many that were published in 1925.&& and the publisher was quite prolific for many years. the series provided working class people with inexpensive access to all kinds of topics including philosophy.&& sexuality.&& science.&& religion.&& law.&& and government. post wwii.&& they published criticism of j. edgar hoover and the founder was subsequently targeted by the fbi for tax evasion. but in 1925.&& they were going strong and one of their prolific writers was clarence darrow..&& darrow was writing about prohibition for the little blue book series in 1925.&& but that is also the year he defended john t. scopes for teaching evolution in his tennessee classroom. the scopes trial generated a huge amount of publicity.&& pitting religion against science.&& and even giving rise to popular songs like these two 78rpm recordings from 1925..&& like the scopes trial.&& prohibition had its passionate adherents and detractors. this was the “roaring 20s” — the year the great gatsby was published — with speakeasies and flappers and iconic cocktails. and yet the pro-prohibition silent film episodes in the life of a gin bottle follows a bottle around as it lures people into a state of dissolution..&& we even see an entire book about throwing parties that includes no alcoholic beverages at all..&& but as much as some things have changed.&& other aspects of our lives remain unchanged. people still want to tell you about their pets.&& rely on self help books.&& read stories to their kids.&& follow celebrities.&& tell each other jokes.&& and make silly videos..&& and the most unchanging part of this particular season.&& of course — children still anticipate the arrival of santa claus with questions.&& wishes and schemes..&& the silent film santa claus features two children who want to know where saint nick lives and how he spends his time. we follow him to the north pole (alaska in disguise) to see santa’s workshop.&& snow castle.&& reindeer.&& and friends and neighbors. jack frost.&& introduced around 14:20.&& appears to be wearing the prototype for ralphie’s bunny suit in “a christmas story” (but with a magic wand). stick around for the sleigh crash at 20:45.&& and right around 22:20 santa wipes out on the ice..&& and just in case you’re still doing your holiday shopping.&& i feel like i should pass on a recommendation from this ad in a 1925 the billboard magazine: armadillo baskets make beautiful christmas gifts. and you can still buy vintage versions online – trust me.&& i looked. you’re welcome..&& and now on to the blockbusters of 1925….&& .&& discogs has cracked the nut.&& struck the right balance.&& and is therefore an absolute internet treasure– thank you..&& if you don’t know them.&& discogs is a central resource for the lp/78/cd music communities.&& and as wikipedia said “as of 28 august 2019 discogs contained over 11.6 million releases.&& by over 6 million artists.&& across over 1.3 million labels.&& contributed from over 456.&&000 contributor user accounts—with these figures constantly growing…”.&& when i met the founder.&& kevin lewandowski.&& a year ago he said the portland based company supports 80 employees and is growing. they make money by being a marketplace for buyers and sellers of discs.  an lp dealer i met in oklahoma sells most of his discs through discogs as well as going at record fairs..&& the data about records is spectacularly clean. compare it to ebay.&& where the data is scattershot.&& and you have something quite different and reusable. it is the best parts of musicbrainz.&& cddb.&& and ebay– where users can catalog their collections and buy/sell records. by starting with the community function.&& kevin said.&& the quality started out really good.&& and then adding the market place later led it to its success..&& but there is something else discogs does that sets it apart from many other commercial websites.&& and this makes all the difference:.&& discogs also makes their data available.&& in bulk.&& and with a free-to-use api..&& the great 78 project has leveraged this bulk database to help find the date of release for 78’s.  just yesterday.&& i downloaded the new dataset and added it to our 78rpm date database.&& and in last year 10’s of thousands more 78’s were added to discogs.&& and we found 1.&&500 more dates for our existing 78’s.   thank you!.&& the internet archive lost vinyl project leverages the api’s by looking up records we will be digitizing to find track listings..&& a donor to our cd project used the public price information to appraise the cds he donated for a tax write-off..&& we want to add links back from discogs to the internet archive and they have not allowed that yet (please please).&& but there is always something more to do..&& i hope other sites.&& even commercial ones.&& would allow bulk access to their data (an api is not enough).   .&& thank you.&& discogs..&& in honor of the esteemed mathematical constant.&& we invite you to celebrate pi day with us!.&& if you’re a math geek.&& we have you covered:.&& if your mathematical knowledge could use a little refresher.&& maybe try this one instead: sir cumference and the dragon of pi : a math adventure..&& you could listen to multiple people recite the first 50 digits of pi in various styles.&& including to the tune of the battle
