[these inexpensive overnight bunks offer spectacular views.&& protection from the elements.&& and lots of local lore..&& “it’s an old.&& moldy.&& grotty dog box. absolutely disgusting. i would think about 10 people get there a year.”.&& that’s how carol exton describes jacs flat bivvy.&& a wood-and-tin hut that sits in a dense forest at the base of a dark valley in new zealand. it’s so small that you have to bend over to crawl inside. yet among the country’s 1.&&000 government-run hiking shelters.&& it’s exton’s favorite. it’s the kind of place that inspires her trekking adventures and exemplifies the lore embedded in new zealand’s beloved hiking culture..&& indeed.&& in a country famous for soaring mountains and rugged coastlines.&& hiking is a way of life. huts line more than 9.&&000 miles of public trails in new zealand.&& providing an ideal framework for exploring..&& not all are two-bunk basics like jacs flat. some are architectural stunners.&& perched on alpine ridges overlooking glaciers. many have been around for more than a hundred years.&& standing as sentinels of old-growth rainforests and golden beaches. through the decades.&& they’ve borne witness to history in the names and messages from past hikers etched on the walls..&& it’s no wonder that these camps—many free or costing a nominal fee—inspire the kind of devotion that can motivate people like exton to visit every hut in the country..&& huts first appeared in new zealand’s remote backcountry in the late 1880s. using local stone.&& sheep herders built them into the tussocked foothills of the southern alps. gold miners scraped tin huts together on the banks of rivers. some outliers were erected on desolate coastlines.&& as refuges for castaways from sunken ships..&& the shelters cropped up in even greater numbers in the mid-20th century.&& in the wake of ecological damage caused by deer.&& chamois.&& and other animals released by european colonists to make new zealand feel more like “home.” over the ensuing decades.&& professional cullers eradicated hundreds of thousands of these animals and left behind a legacy of six bunk huts in some of the most isolated parts of the country..&& (these stellar hotels embrace their geography.).&& more huts arose from stranger circumstances. along the rugged south coast of fiordland.&& in a sea cave not far above the high-tide line.&& lies a five-bunk hut built by a man named owen west. “westy.&&” as he was known.&& alighted at this spot in the mid-1980s after jumping off a fishing boat following an argument. according to legend.&& he swam through formidable surf to the shore.&& where he pulled flotsam and jetsam from the sea to build his abode..&& then there are the huts that sheltered people on the run. ellis hut.&& in ruahine forest park.&& is named after jack ellis.&& an accused murderer who hid here from authorities in 1904. asbestos cottage.&& in kahurangi national park.&& was once the home of a woman escaping an abusive husband. she fled to the mountain hideaway with her lover in 1914 and lived there for 30 years..&& many huts had former lives as schoolhouses.&& lighthouse keeper cabins.&& and homesteads—all eventually converted for public use. by the time the department of conservation (doc) was formed and inherited the entire hut network in 1987.&& there were hundreds of huts scattered like buckshot through the mountains of new zealand..&& these origin stories combined with each hut’s architectural features (or lack thereof) add to the lore that make hiking in new zealand so appealing..&& brian dobbie.&& 64.&& worked on the team that manages the hut network since doc’s inception. over the past 34 years.&& he’s seen all manner of huts.&& including one painted bright purple with orange flowers.&& where he spent a funky night in the 1980s..&& he believes that because doc huts are always open and accessible to everyone.&& they foster a certain conviviality among strangers. he recalls one trip when a torrential downpour drove him and dozens of others out of their flooding tents and into one small hut. “at one stage there were 30 of us in the six-bunk hut.&&” he says. “we had less than three square feet each.” they cheerfully made do..&& (from australia to morocco.&& travelers share heartwarming tales of kindness.).&& that’s part of the allure.&& says dobbie. even the humblest shack can take on a significance that transcends its corrugated iron roof and timber walls. they become places of connection and self-reflection.&& places where memories are made and simple pleasures savored..&& the logbooks tell the tales in the scribbles of hikers passing through. in lesser-used huts—the most popular kind—logbooks might date back years.&& with only a handful of entries recorded over a 12-month stretch. not all are made of paper. “the logbook for jacs flat bivvy is the door.&&” says exton.&& where people have scratched their names along with a few short phrases about where they’re going and what they’re doing..&& this recording tradition means some huts yield startling finds. on a wall in double hut.&& in hakatere conservation park.&& in canterbury.&& dobbie spied a particularly famous name scrawled among several others. “[it] was sir edmund hillary.&&” he says. “of course.&& [he didn’t write] ‘sir edmund.’ it was ‘ed hillary.’ this man.&& who topped the highest mountain in the world.&& also stayed here and left his mark.”.&& the potential for uncovering such hidden stories is one reason some particularly zealous hikers have made it their mission to visit every hut in the doc network. these “hut baggers.&&” as they call themselves.&& come from all walks of life and have often been obsessed since childhood..&& exton grew up in a suburb of wellington.&& bordered by the harbor on one side and steep bush-covered slopes on the other. while her classmates walked home from school along the road.&& exton took to the hills. “for two or three hours between school and teatime i used to just go off and explore.&&” she recalls. now 60.&& exton often disappears into the hills.&& packrafting.&& kayaking.&& and hiking her way to some of the most remote huts in the country. so far.&& she’s clocked 525 huts..&& she thrives on the irresistible allure of huts scattered through the wilderness.&& just waiting to be found. the more difficult to access.&& the greater the thrill. reaching jacs flat bivvy took two attempts.&& a three-day trek and “a hard 12 hours” of hiking.&& she says..&& (lake bagging is trending. what is it and how can you do it safely?).&& benjamin piggot loves the freedom that hut-hiking affords. “it’s an escape.&&” says the 25-year-old. “it’s time to go reset with your friends.&& have a cup of tea around the fire.&& and talk about things that actually matter.”.&& piggot visited his first hut when he was 11 years old.&& which sparked a lifelong passion. since going all in 10 years ago.&& he’s logged 312 huts. his favorite is east matakitaki.&& reachable via a six-day hike into nelson lakes national park. “it was just a brilliant trip.&& lots of snow.&& lots of adventure.&& one of those trips where you were cold and wet most of the time.&&” he remembers..&& feeling bonded to nature is what hut hiking is all about. “new zealanders are an outdoor going kind of people.&&” piggot says. “i think that we have a deep-seated connection.&& to ngahere [in the maori language].&& to the land and the forest.”.&& copyright © 1996-2015 national geographic societycopyright © 2015-2022 national geographic partners.&&
