[we work with ads partners to bring you more useful and interesting advertising content through interest-based advertising. for example.&& we may do this based on information that ad partners share with us. we hope that this increases the usefulness of twitter ads for you..&& here’s one way it would work. let’s say a flower shop wants to advertise a valentine’s day special on twitter. they’d prefer to show their ad to floral enthusiasts who subscribe to their newsletter. to get the special offer to those people.&& who are also on twitter.&& the shop may share with us hashed emails from their mailing list. we can then match that to a hash of emails that our users have associated with their accounts in order to show them a promoted tweet for the valentine’s day deal on twitter..&& another way this works is when a person visits the flower shop’s website. in that case.&& twitter may collect information that enables the shop owner to advertise through twitter and reach those visitors with a valentine’s day offer.  .&& in addition to helping advertisers to reach their audiences on twitter.&& twitter also works with third-party advertising partners.&& including google.&& to market twitter’s own services.&& including through the delivery of interest-based ads. these partners may also serve ads on behalf of twitter advertisers. the privacy options described below apply to interest-based ads served by twitter;
