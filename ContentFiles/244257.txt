[article.&& the massachusetts woman suffrage association chose the bluebird as their symbol leading up to a 1915 state referendum on women’s access to the vote. on suffrage blue bird day (july 19.&& 1915) as many as 100.&&000 of these tin bluebird signs were displayed across the state. the 1915 massachusetts referendum failed.&& and women did not get the vote in massachusetts until the passage of the 19th amendment to the us constitution.[1].&& in the popular mainstream culture of the suffrage era.&& women were associated with animals perceived as passive.&& like cats. middle class.&& white women were expected to stay in the home. men.&& on the other hand.&& were expected to be outdoors. they often played sports or did other forms of physical exercise. men were often associated with physically active animals like dogs. anti-suffrage artists used these animals symbolically in their cartoons..&& anti-suffrage organizations in britain used cats to try to make the point that women were simple and delicate. the cartoons implied that women’s suffrage was just as absurd as cat suffrage because women (and cats) were incapable of voting..&& while gold was the only color used by all us suffrage organizations (though white also became widely adopted once parades started).&& the purple.&& white.&& and gold combination was used only by the national woman’s party in the united states. the organization described the meaning of these colors in a newsletter published december 6.&& 1913: “purple is the color of loyalty.&& constancy to purpose.&& unswerving steadfastness to a cause. white.&& the emblem of purity.&& symbolizes the quality of our purpose; and gold.&& the color of light and life.&& is as the torch that guides our purpose.&& pure and unswerving.”[3.&& 4].&& these were the colors used by the women’s social and political union in england. they adopted these colors in 1908. purple represented royalty and “the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette.&& the instinct of freedom and dignity;” white represented purity; and green represented hope and “the emblem of spring.”[a] alice paul protested in england with the women’s social and political union in england.&& and brought the tactics of their leader.&& emmeline pankhurst.&& back to the united states. [4].&& suffragists were often portrayed as masculine and ugly. to help counter that anti-suffrage media image.&& suffragists wore dresses in parades. these were often all white.&& with suffrage sashes. these white dresses symbolized the femininity and purity of the suffrage cause. [4].&& in 1867.&& kansas suffragists adopted the sunflower.&& the state flower.&& as a symbol of their campaign. from then on.&& yellow (gold) became associated with the national women’s suffrage movement.[5.&& 6] it was described as “the color of light and life.&& is as the torch that guides our purpose.&& pure and unswerving.”[3] gold and white were the only colors that all us suffrage organizations used. [4].&& in 1920.&& suffragists and anti-suffragists met in nashville.&& tennessee to lobby the state legislature for and against ratifying the nineteenth amendment. arguments on both sides were intense – tennessee was poised to either be the needed 36th state to ratify the amendment for it to become law or to reject ratification and ensure the fight continued. both sides wore rose-shaped pins to indicate which side of the battle they were on: suffragists work yellow roses.&& and anti-suffragists wore red roses.[7].&& in 1867.&& kansas suffragists adopted the sunflower.&& the state flower.&& as the symbol of their campaign. prior to this.&& elizabeth cady stanton had written for the lily.&& a largely temperance-focused newspaper out of seneca falls.&& under the pen name.&& “sunflower.” many advocates of temperance.&& like elizabeth cady stanton.&& saw a direct connection between women’s access to the vote and the support and creation of temperance laws..&& in 1917.&& silent sentinels.&& organized by the national woman’s party.&& stood in silent vigil outside of the white house as a strategy to raise awareness for woman suffrage. once the united states entered world war i.&& the public’s tolerance for protest diminished. more than 90 of the silent sentinels were arrested on charges of obstructing traffic and were sent to prison both in dc and at occoquan in virginia. while imprisoned.&& they were beaten.&& force fed.&& and other indignities. the publicity of their mistreatment was instrumental in changing the opinions of the public and of congress regarding woman suffrage. silver pins shaped like a jail cell door with a heart-shaped padlock were given by the national woman’s party to each of the women “jailed for freedom.”[5.&& 6] the national woman’s party “jailed for freedom” pin was based on the holloway prison pin that english suffragette sylvia pankhurst gave to members of the women’s social and political union who had been imprisoned..&& on the flag of the united states.&& each state in the union is represented by a star. in 1919.&& the national woman’s party led by alice paul began sewing stars on a giant purple.&& white.&& and gold flag. each time a state ratified the nineteenth amendment.&& a new star would be sewn on the flag. there was room on the national woman’s party flag for 36 stars.&& symbolizing the number of state ratifications required for the amendment to become law..&& [1] national museum of american history. woman suffrage bluebird sign. national museum of american history: collections.&& [2] national park service. “women’s suffrage and the cat.” national park service..&& [3] from the suffragist.&& december 6.&& 1913..&& [4] h-net. “suffragist colors discussion (march 1997).” h-women..&& [5] national museum of american history. “treasures of american history: woman suffrage.” national museum of american history.&& [6] blake.&& debbie. “the colours of the suffragettes.” women’s history bites.&& november 25.&& 2014..&& [7] bomboy.&& scott. “the vote that led to the 19th amendment.” constitution daily (national constitution center).&& august 18.&& 2019..&& last updated: april 6.&& 2020.&& download the official nps app before your next visit.&& ][open menu, explore this park, symbols of the womens suffrage movement, animals: bluebird, animals: cats and dogs, colors: purple, white, and gold, colors: purple, white, and green, colors: white, colors: gold, flowers: roses (yellow and red), flowers: sunflower, jail cell door, stars, you might also like, tags]symbols of the womens suffrage movement (u.s. national park service)[animals: bluebird, sources][skip to global nps navigation, skip to main content, skip to footer, explore this park, explore this park, womens history, 19th amendment, animals, plants, symbolism, suffrage, accessibility, privacy policy, foia, notices, disclaimer, faq, no fear act, contact the national park service, usa.gov, facebook facebook facebook, youtube youtube youtube, twitter twitter twitter, instagram instagram instagram, flickr flickr flickr]
