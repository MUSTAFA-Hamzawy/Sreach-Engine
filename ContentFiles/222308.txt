[with special fibers that convert tiny vibrations to voltages, a new fabric senses sound. someday, such fabrics could monitor the body or aid hearing., cellulose gives plants their strength. engineers are turning this renewable, environmentally friendly resource into brand new materials., it’s made by pressure-cooking sawdust and water, is cheap and easy to make — and could lead to greener cleaning products than chemicals used today., researchers have developed a liquid metal that breaks down carbon dioxide in the air, converting it from a climate threat into a valuable raw material., bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist only online. yet the environmental impacts of their networks affect the real world., whether cash or credit, phone apps or digital currencies — all forms of payment have behind-the-scenes costs. and these can vary dramatically., scientists thought washing machines were a leading contributor of microplastics. now it appears dryers may be an even bigger problem., unlike the atoms in other solids, the atoms in glass don’t exist in an orderly crystal structure. they’re more jumbled up, like the atoms inside liquids., researchers have developed a camera the size of a coarse grain of salt that takes amazingly clear photos., metals can bend and pull without snapping, and conduct electricity. the reason: their atoms tend to lose electrons to neighboring atoms.,
