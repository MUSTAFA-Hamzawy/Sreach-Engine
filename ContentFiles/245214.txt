sentences. phonics story books usually have a few simple rules that can help children build confidence in reading. a phonics short story can focus on a particular sound or combination of sounds such as a particular short vowel or vowel consonant combinations in word families. kiz phonics currently offers 21 short stories to help children build early confidence in reading. it is important you do not start by giving a child complicated text with several unfamiliar phonemic structures. that way.&& reading can soon been considered a nightmare. our phonics stories are short and fun for children to read.&& as they contain a mixture of consonant and vowel sounds aligned with their level of development. we have phonics stories for kindergarten.&& first grade and second grade which get slightly more challenging as the child develops..&& take the story fox and dog focus on the o sound. the story helps children read by focusing on word families og.&& op and ox along with a few high frequency sight words. decodable phonics stories target specific phonics skills and kiz phonics does an excellent job in this domain. but do not stop here. you should also use a variety of books from other phonics publishers. in fact.&& we recommend having a library of easily accessible phonics books and short stories that kids can reach out and grab at any time..&& when children are at the very beginning of their literacy journey.&& phonics books should be around to help them develop print awareness. books can be embedded with toys to gently nudge children towards reading. such an approach creates a positive attitude towards books which leads to lifelong learning. the early experiences of a child stays with them through adulthood and forms a core part of their personality and attitudes..&& in sum.&& phonics stories and literacy books are a fun way to encourage children to learn to read. stories that entertain and educate will lead to the development of early reading comprehension skills. comprehension is the next step after learning to read. at the very beginning it is more important that children sound out sentences. as they get more confident we can test
