[prince harry has starred in a cringe-inducing skit promoting his new eco-travel project which would see holidaymakers 'rated' for their green credentials. in a five-minute video published on the youtube page of the duke's new non-profit travalyst, the queen's grandson goes for a jog through new zealand woodland before running into kiwi actors rhys darby, david fane and rena owen. jumanji star darby accuses harry - who is sporting a 'girl dad' t-shirt and apple airpod headphones -  of dropping a lolly wrapper at auckland's bethells beach during his tour of the country with wife meghan markle in october 2018. he gives harry his three stars out of five and praises him for only using one towel during his stay, for buying local honey, and for not leaving the tap running while brushing his teeth. it comes as harry launched his new eco-travel project during an interview with te ao with moana on māori television in new zealand., keith anderson expressed concern over a 'huge increase' in customers struggling to pay for their energy, and said ministers were running out of time to set up a financial support scheme. he said annual bills are about to soar to £2,900 this autumn if wholesale gas prices continue to sky-rocket - exacerbated by the war in ukraine and a scramble for alternative suppliers to russia - over the coming months. households have already seen a 54 per cent rise in the energy tariff price cap on april 1 (pictured, rising prices over the last 12 months), adding about £700 to annual bills and taking them close to £2,000. but these are expected to rise substantially once again in another six months, as industry figures continue to champion the need for a social tariff., chancellor rishi sunak, who leads the department, has made it clear he expects his officials to be in the office at least some of the time, but has not yet dictated a minimum., the labour leader is reported to be taking soundings over how to react to durham police's decision to investigate him over the boozy curry event he held with colleagues in april last year., according to a yougov survey, 46 per cent of voters believe the labour leader should quit if police found he broke covid rules over his boozy curry with colleagues in april last year., bbc presenter eilidh barbour led a walkout at the scottish football writers' association (sfwa) awards in glasgow over 'sexist and racist' jokes made by a keynote speaker., warning: graphic content: christopher pine was ploughing a field in somerset when he was first hit in the face with dirt by a stranger who later threw a missile at his head., vladimir putin appeared to be walking with a heavy step and watched moscow's victory day parade with his lap covered by a blanket - despite geriatric war veterans sitting uncovered around him - in the latest sign he could be suffering poor heath. the 69-year-old used a speech at the parade to project an image of russian military might and strength by trumpeting 'great victory' in the war on ukraine and accusing the west of plotting against him. but climbing down from the stage he appeared to be walking with a heavy step - as if trying to disguise a limp - and was also seen covering himself with a blanket. in conversation with defence minister sergei shoigu, his lips fidgeted in a similar way to a service on eastern sunday which drew comments from hi critics, and his face also appeared puffy. it will do little to dispel rumours about his health which began almost two years ago with accusations he is suffering from parkinson's and cancer, and have intensified since he ordered his troops to invade ukraine., the russian leader, 69, is said to have been in a secret relationship with olympic gold medallist alina kabaeva, 38, since 2008, and the couple share two children., in mariupol, a city brought to ruin by persistent russian shelling and blockades, kremlin puppet denis pushilin marched through the streets chanting and waving flags., the 'no to war' message also warned viewers that 'tv and the authorities lie' as it appeared on schedules and programmes including children's tv shows, affecting viewers across the country. the hack came as russians prepared to watch the annual victory day military parade on red square presided over by vladimir putin (top right). it impacted online viewers of various channels transmitted by mts mobile operator, ntv plus, rostelecom and wink. it is not yet known who carried out the cyber attack., putin lost his 40th colonel in ukraine in the latest milestone of russia's faltering invasion. lt col alexander blinov, 42, was killed on march 15 but his death was denied. his grave has been pictured, the prominent billionaire has told associates that the kremlin leader's 'psychiatric health is bad indeed, and 'stories about him going bonkers are not a joke'., vladimir putin addressed the russian military in moscow's red square today as the country marks victory day - telling them the west was planning to invade before he attacked ukraine, a move he called 'the only right decision'. twisting the truth of russia's battlefield defeats against kyiv's men, he hailed a day of 'great victory' and promised to defeat 'neo-nazis' in ukraine - repeating false claims from the kremlin that kyiv is being ruled by a fascist regime. but he stopped short of what many had feared: an official declaration of war on kyiv which would have allowed him to mobilise russia's military reserves and conscript civilians in order to escalate fighting across the border. and a planned flyover by his 'doomsday jet' - which would allow him to continue ruling russia in the event of a nuclear blast - was also axed at the last minute, allegedly due to fears it could be attacked., new measures against imports from russia - adding an additional 35 percentage point tariff - will cover £1.4billion worth of goods, including platinum and palladium., musk, 50, has been using starlink, a constellation of more than 2,000 satellites in low earth orbit, beaming internet connections to dishes around the world, with a large presence in ukraine., sergei andreev, moscow's man in warsaw, had been attempting to lay wreaths at the cemetery of soviet soldiers in the polish capital to mark victory day - the surrender of nazi germany to the allies in 1945 - when he was pelted by pro-ukraine protesters who also branded him a 'fascist'. video showed andreev and his security detail being hit with multiple objects before a bag of red paint was thrown into his face by a crowd waving ukrainian flags. eventually polish police arrived and escorted him away. the ugly confrontation took place despite the embassy calling off the event just two days ago because poland could not guarantee its safety. russian state media immediately jumped on the attack as evidence of what it called 'neo-nazis' operating in the west., the highly acclaimed scottish actor, 29, who was a toddler when he came to britain as a rwandan refugee, is the first black actor to play the role full-time and will take over from jodie whittaker., ncuti gatwa told fans his 'heart is very very full' after an emotional sunday which saw him announced as the next time lord in doctor who., 'hawks' and 'doves' around the cabinet table are at odds over britain taking unilateral action to scrap key parts of the northern ireland protocol, it has emerged., the supermarket giant has fended off competition from the billionaire issa brothers, who also own asda, with an offer that is expected to see mccoll's stores and workforce preserved in their entirety., passengers at manchester airport (pictured right and inset right) say they are facing a two-hour wait at security check-in this morning, with queues leading outside the terminal and into a nearby car-park. meanwhile, at birmingham airport (pictured left and inset left), passengers have complained of 'ridiculous' queues at departures today, with long queues outside the main terminal building. there are also delays to flights, with at least ten late flights at manchester and four at birmingham as of 8am this morning. meanwhile at stansted, there were also claims of two-hour delays at passport control last night. it comes as airports up and down the uk continue to face staffing issues in the wake of covid restrictions. travel chiefs say the issues have been exacerbated by a huge increase in demand for travel following two years of covid-enforced disruption. with holidaymakers flocking to airports this morning at the start of a new week, passengers again faced delays at manchester and birmingham. bosses of both airports today said the queues were due to the ongoing staffing problems. it is also understood that manchester has suffered additional problem, including passengers arriving up to six hours before their flight in the hope of beating the queues - creating bottlenecks at already busy times. however there did not appear to be queues at heathrow and gatwick today. passengers at the travel hubs, the uk's two biggest airports, faced delays over easter - when millions jetted off for a four-day weekend. one holidaymaker flying out from manchester airport today branded the situation a 'sh*t show', while others at birmingham airport said they feared missing their flight., the £6 o'keeffe's healthy feet has been crowned a 'wonder cream' with thousands of shoppers claiming it 'works like magic' to smooth rough, cracked heels., if your mattress is old, noticeably saggy, and negatively affecting your sleep, you might need a new mattress. but they don't always come cheap. the alternative? a mattress topper., people from around the world have taken to anonymous sharing app whisper to reveal what happened after they reunited with an ex-partner they hadn't contacted in years., councils are expected to be handed discretionary powers to hike charges when properties are not either regularly used or let out by their owners for at least 70 days per year., meghan markle 'came from nothing' and 'trampled on others' to 'get to the top' like a politician or a tycoon, her acid-penned biographer has revealed.
