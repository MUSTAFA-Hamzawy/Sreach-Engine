[.&& most word processing programs have a built-in spell checker.&& but business correspondence still goes out with misspelled words that a checker would have caught..&& i’m not talking about words like bare and bear.&& which are both english words acceptable to an automatic spelling program.&& but words like definite and separate.&& which have no homophones.&& and typos like standarad for standard (one of my own recent embarrassments)..&& writers need to keep two things in mind about spell checkers: 1. they cannot catch any misspellings if a writer doesn’t let the application run. 2. they cannot be entirely trusted to catch every spelling error..&& for whatever reason–overconfidence or sloth–the same misspellings continue to appear in business emails.&& advertising copy.&& resumes.&& and on blog sites. the writer’s best defense is to take a good look at the most frequent misspellings and zero in on every letter in the word..&& mastering a few at a time is a better way to approach the task than scanning long lists..&& here are ten of the most frequent misspellings.&& their correct forms.&& and tips that may help you remember the differences..&& 1. misspelled: seperate correct: separate tip: there’s a rat in sep-a-rate..&& 2. misspelled: definate correct: definite tip: take a close look at the final syllable: nite..&& 3. misspelled: calender correct: calendar tip: you probably pronounce the last syllable as [er].&& so you have to think [ar] as you write it: cal-en-dar..&& 4. misspelled: mispell correct: misspell tip: you know how to spell spell; add the prefix mis- to it: mis-spell..&& 5. misspelled: privlege correct: privilege tip: you may pronounce this three-syllable word with only two syllables. notice the second i: priv-i-lege. another common misspelling is privilige. note the e in the final syllable: priv-i-lege..&& 6. misspelled: arguement correct: argument tip: the verb argue ends in e.&& but you must drop the e for ar-gu-ment..&& 7. misspelled: concensus correct: consensus tip: the sensus in consensus has nothing to do with the word census. our word census comes from latin censare.&& “to rate.&& assess.” consensus comes from latin consensus.&& “agreement.&& accord.&& sympathy.&& common feeling.” think sss: con-sen-sus..&& 8. misspelled: pronounciation correct: pronunciation tip: there’s no “ounce” in pronunciation.&& but there is a “nun.” the verb is pronounce; the noun is pro-nun-ci-a-tion..&& 9. misspelled: accomodate correct: accommodate tip: two sets of double letters.&& cc and mm: accommodate.&& 10. misspelled: dependant correct: dependent tip: people who misspell this one may be thinking of defendant.&& which does end in –ant (although the –ant in defendant is also pronounced [ent].) note the final syllable in dependent: de-pen-dent..&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day? get a subscription and start receiving our writing tips and exercises daily!.&& my own mnemonic for accommodate is: ‘accommodate one more m in the word’. ‘don’t be embarrassed.&& by missing out the double r and double s in the word.’ and.&& ‘harass has an ass’!.&& and i am sorry! the tenth word.&& ‘dependant’ is not necessarily misspelt/wrong. it is a different noun. “a person who relies on another person for support (especially financial support)” is the definition by wordweb dictionary..&& i often see forward and foreword used incorrectly.&& and acknowledgment misspelled as acknowledgement..&& regarding number 10.&& in british english (or in australia).&& dependent is the adjective whereas dependant is a noun. a dependant is someone who depends on someone else.&& like young children or a non-working spouse. in american english.&& both adjective and noun are spelled the same..&& regarding number 2.&& i often see definitely spelled ‘defiantly’. as this is a valid word in its own right.&& it is not picked up by spell checkers..&& “accommodate” reminded me of one i have problems with: recommend. i tend to double the c.&& because the words are similar..&& i have another tip for picking up those misspellings and even missing words. since our brains compensate for errors and ommissions when we are reading forward (the normal way).&& reading backwards when proofreading is a great way to spot the mistakes. in other words.&& read the last word first.&& the second to the last word next.&& etc. try it and see!.&& very well-taken. i don’t think the “rat” in separate really helps though.&& does it? it seems that the mistake there tends to happen with an errant e for the first a.&& seperate.&& rather than the second– separete. i don’t think i’ve ever seen separete..&& for me.&& double letters are the most vexing: omission vs ommission.&& occurrence vs occurence.&& and pairs like refer/reference/referring.&& infer/inference/inferring.&& where the consonant gets doubled sometimes and sometimes not for the suffix. i remember defandant because in court it is commonly pronounced “defendant” with a pronounced emphasis on the last syllable.&& and definite by likening to the word *finite*. i think for me the problem is not so much that if i stop and think.&& i know the proper form.&& but that the “wrong” spelling in these cases doesn’t look wrong to me right off.&& so i don’t stop and think about it. being me.&& of course.&& i am obligated to point out that many spelling errors occur due to pronunciation errors– like that one. many words are spelled pretty phonetically when they are simply said properly: government.&& governor.&& arctic.&& diph(f not p)thong.&& chipot-lee (lay).&& electoral.&& nuclear.&& real-tor.&& et cetera..&& venqax.&& my tip for separate works if it’s formatted they way i want it. the mnemonic is “there’s a rat in sep-a-rate.”.&& a rat. got it now. 🙂.&& @hariki: ozimarco is correct. in american english there are no dependants.&& only dependents who are.&& by definition.&& dependent. and this site is primarily focused on american english as opposed to british and commonwealth forms.&& which seem to delight in superfluous letters and multiple forms for some reason. 😉.&& the word “acknowledgement” is a spelling from some parts of the british commonwealth.&& just as “judgement” is.**.&& one of my favorite writers of science fiction was a man from northern ireland named james white.&& and one of his novels he named all judgement fled..&& mr.&& white died of a stroke several years ago.&& but a few years before that.&& he had been awarded a medal for surviving for 50 years on on shots of insulin.&& that is an extraordinarily long time to survive on insulin because diabetes is such a difficiult disease to manage. d.a.w..&& **my guess is that they probably spell “acknowledgment” in canada and maybe the bahamas they same way that we do in the u.s.a..&& hi there! i m a regular reader of your subscription.&& which i get in emails 🙂 i m very happy that i’ve improved a lot...&& i m not confidant in spellings.&& means i do a lots of mistakes.&& how can refrain from this?
