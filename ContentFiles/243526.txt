about a particular api query that was slowing down his work.&& and he couldn’t figure out why he was having this problem. after a couple back and forths with a developer in chicago.&& he figured out that he was selecting a date range that was too wide and was able to resolve the issue to get the results under a second. before stack overflow for enterprise.&& there was no way to connect the two.&&
