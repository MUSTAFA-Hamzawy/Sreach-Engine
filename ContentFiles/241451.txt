[.&& .&& for filipino film critics such as myself.&& the online and hybrid festivals were a blessing. it opened many doors which were otherwise closed due to our material realities. of these.&& the international film festival rotterdam (which i participated in through the young film critics programme) and the qcinema international film festival provided an unparalleled selection of films.&& an accommodating press office.&& and unique efforts that attempted to capture the spirit of the onsite events..&& this list that i have constructed.&& which is a mix of short films and feature-length entries.&& is an attempt at capturing the cinema that excited me.&& challenged my perceptions of what film can be.&& and made me miss the theatrical experience at its fullest glory..&& films released in 2021:.&& older films encountered for the first time in 2021:.&& the hand of god.&& while i have seen plenty of 2021 releases.&& i do not yet feel i can make a complete list of favourite films that i would be satisfied with. instead.&& i would like to offer a selection of older works i watched for the first time this year that helped enlighten me in some way.&& in the hope that they will enlighten you.&& too. .&& the following list are short works.&& all under an hour.&& and many are fledgling efforts from careers that became storied over time. what stands out in all of them is their willingness to find meanings outside of conventional formal strictures—blending.&& blurring.&& or entirely doing away with oppressive parameters and rendering exciting new sites of experimentation. the spheeris films also hold a special place in my heart for introducing me to the indelible.&& inspiring jenifer michaels.&& who ought to be elevated to the status of a trans icon for how visible and open she was about her transition in the early 1970s..&& it is of vital importance to be as fluent and literate in the history of queer cinema as possible.&& and i was fortunate enough to immerse myself in a healthy mix of canonical classics and lesser-known works that were no less stirring in their daring frankness. take bressan’s film.&& which is one of the first narrative features to confront the horrors of the aids crisis head-on.&& which then makes for a moving pairing with epstein and friedman’s testimonial work about those featured on the aids memorial quilt. or karen black’s gutsy and honest performance as a trans woman in altman’s drama.&& which seems like a natural complement to candy darling’s moving appearance in nelson’s film over a decade earlier. as one watches more and more queer cinema.&& one can begin appreciating the silent conversations these films have with one another—allies in arms.&& documenting lives that had been hidden from the mainstream for so long..&& i group the next films together not to highlight any unifying thematic strands.&& but because i viewed each one with a close friend (albeit remotely). one of the great joys that we have is sharing cinema in a communal setting; even better is watching a film with someone who will delight in your witty asides and breezy observations. sometimes a film needs to be brought down to size.&& while other times it’s okay to revel in the miraculous things it can do and doing all this with a friend can make even the day’s toughest stresses melt away..&&  every year.&& there are several films i watch for the sole reason because they were pointed in my direction by people whose taste i could trust. even films i had known existed prior to 2021.&& i watched this year due to the unyielding passion of people who were willing to champion them. to which i say: thank you for letting me share in your love.&& for i now love them.&& too..&& and here.&& finally.&& are a selection of films that stole my heart.&& gripped me.&& and.&& in their own individual ways.&& inspired me with their resourcefulness..&& i will end by making note of a physical release i believe to be essential: the fred halsted collection from altered innocence (2021). three landmark works from gay adult film’s heyday are restored in this fantastic set.&& as well as a work once thought to be lost that was fortuitously located on vhs and digitized. the creators behind the wonderful ask any buddy podcast.&& as well as several noteworthy scholars.&& provide a litany of context and historical insight that is amazingly thorough.&& so that this release ultimately becomes a testament to the importance of preserving this cinematic history before it fades away completely..&& 1. annette (leos carax.&& 2020) beginning (dea kulumbegashvili.&& 2020) des portes et des déserts (of gates and of deserts.&& loredana bianconi.&& 2021) exterminate all the brutes (raoul peck.&& 2021) minamata mandala (kazuo hara.&& 2020) ras vkhedavt.&& rodesac cas vukurebt?

noir. since having access again to amazon and netflix.&& i have discovered federico fellini for the first time.&& the films of youssef chahine.&& and some of the releases i missed whilst overseas. i also watched two great australian produced documentaries on the film industry: iron fists and kung fu kicks (serge ou.&& 2019) and electric boogaloo: the wild.&& untold story of cannon films (mark
