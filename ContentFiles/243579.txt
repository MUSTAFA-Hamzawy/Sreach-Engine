on this star wars day.&& i got more than 8.&&400. now.&& not all of them are related to the first star wars movie.&& registered by twentieth century-fox in 1977—for example.&& some are about the star wars defense system from the 1980s. but most are on topic.&& and several can be seen in the find yourself in copyright exhibit..&& how do i find myself in star wars? i’m an old-school fan—the original trilogy was a huge part of my childhood. i know i’m not alone.&& given that all three original movies have been added to the national film registry. i remember seeing the films in the theater.&& and i remember how big of a deal it was when star wars was on tv for the first time. but even greater are my memories of the creative works that came from the movies..&& deposit copy for “star wars” sheet music registration..&& the music immediately takes me back. john williams composed and conducted the iconic soundtracks for star wars episodes i–ix. his creativity inspired many recordings and arrangements.&& including the number one hit “star wars theme/cantina band” space disco recording by meco in 1977. many of the songs on the soundtracks don’t have lyrics.&& but “ewok celebration” at the end of return of the jedi does. john williams composed and conducted the music.&& and bantha music registered the work with original english lyrics by joseph williams and ewokese lyrics by ben burtt..&& long before the days of on-demand movies.&& my brother and i had the story of star wars album—a condensed audio soundtrack of the movie. we listened to it so much that i still.&& when watching the movie now.&& can remember the exact point in the dialogue where we had to flip the record. we also had star wars bedsheets.&& lunch boxes.&& t-shirts.&& sticker books.&& and the seemingly impossible to defeat empire strikes back atari game. since then.&& approximately 100 star wars video games have been released.&& with far more realistic graphics than my 1982 game..&& one of many star wars registration cards..&& but where i really find myself in star wars is remembering the countless hours playing with the action figures and spaceships. for years.&& every birthday party and holiday meant new star wars toys. our death star toy was my favorite.&& with the retractable bridge.&& rope for luke and leia to swing from.&& and the best part.&& the trash compactor—complete with foam “trash.&&” the trash monster.&& and the closing-in walls. we also had multiple x-wing fighters.&& tie fighters.&& and lightsabers; luke’s landspeeder; the millennium falcon; the droid factory; and every action figure imaginable..&& as we celebrate may the fourth this and every year.&& i hope you too find yourself in star wars. because.&& as obi-wan kenobi said.&& “the force will be with you.&& always.”.&& posted in: copyright.&& copyright lore.&& film.&& find yourself in copyright.&& motion pictures.&& music.&& uncategorized.&& add a comment ».&& did you know that qualifying libraries and archives can preemptively opt out of participating in the ccb even before any claim is brought against them?
