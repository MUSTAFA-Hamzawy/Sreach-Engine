(and reading this column it has reminded me that no two words are ever exactly alike.) so at the end.&& i take time to examine my choice of words. i have a lot of fun selecting the exact words to pinpoint my thoughts or points..&& 15. amit goyal to be a good writer is to start writing everyday. as mark twain said.&& “the secret of getting ahead is getting started.”.&& try using new words. i.e avoid repeating words. this way we learn the usage of different words. do edit your previous articles..&& start with small paragraphs like writing an article for a newspaper.&& and proceed from there..&& 16. john dodds remove as many adjectives as possible. read jack finney’s tale.&& cousin len’s wonderful adjective cellar for a fantastical tale about how a hack becomes a successful author with the help of a magical salt cellar that removes adjectives from his work..&& 17. john ireland i set my writing aside and edit a day or two later with the aim of making it terse. it has trained me to be more conscious of brevity when writing for immediate distribution..&& 18. jai try to write in simple way. express your views with most appropriate words..&& 19. mark read great writers for inspiration. if you read them enough.&& their excellent writing style will rub off onto your dazzling blog..&& you are what you read (and write!)..&& 20. caroline i watch my action tense and wordiness in sentences when i am writing my technical diddley..&& for example.&& in a sentence where you say …”you will have to…” i replace it with “…you must…”.&& or “click on the go button to…” can be replaced with “click go to…”..&& think of words such as “enables”.&& instead of “allows you to” or “helps you to”..&& if one word will work where three are.&& replace it! i always find these.&& where i slip into conversational as i am writing quickly.&& then go back and purge.&& purge.&& purge..&& 21. akhil tandulwadikar don’t shy away from adopting the good habits that other writers use..&& do not worry about the length of the article as long as it conveys the point. of course.&& the fewer words you use.&& the better..&& start the article with a short sentence.&& not more than 8 words..&& 22. julie martinenza instead of adding tags (he said/she said) to every bit of dialogue.&& learn to identify the speaker by showing him/her in action. example: “pass that sweet-smelling turkey this way.” with knife in one hand and fork in the other.&& sam looked eager to pounce..&& 23. aaron stroud write often and to completion by following a realistic writing schedule..&& 24. joanna young one that works for me every time is to focus on the positive intention behind my writing. what is it that i want to communicate.&& express.&& convey? by focusing on that.&& by getting into the state that i’m trying to express.&& i find that i stop worrying about the words – just let them tumble out of their own accord..&& it’s a great strategy for beating writer’s block.&& or overcoming anxiety about a particular piece of writing.&& whether that’s composing a formal business letter.&& writing a piece from the heart.&& or guest blogging somewhere ‘big’….&& 25. shelley rodrigo use others writer’s sentences and paragraphs as models and then emulate the syntactic structure with your own content. i’ve learned more about grammar and punctuation that way..&& 26. sylvia avoid long sentences..&& 27. mike feeney learn the difference between me.&& myself and i. for example: “contact bob or myself if you have any questions.” i hear this very often!.&& 28. richard scott when doing a long project.&& a novel.&& for instance.&& shut off your internal editor and just write..&& think of your first draft as a complex outline waiting to be expanded upon.&& and let the words flow..&& 29. david careful with unnecessary expressions. “at this point in time” came along during the nixon congressional hearings. too bad it didn’t go out with him. what about “on a daily basis?”.&& 30. e. i. sanchez for large documents.&& i use word’s speech feature to have the computer read the article back. this allows me to catch errors i have missed – especially missing words or words that ’sort of sound the same’ but are spelled differently (e.g. front me instead of ‘from me’)..&& 31. cat either read the book “writing tools 50 strategies for every writer”.&& by roy peter clark.&& or read the fifty writing tools: quick list on his blog. then join a writing group.&& or hire a writing coach..&& 32. suemagoo write the first draft spontaneously. switch off your internal editor until it is time to review your first draft..&& 33. lydia if you’re writing fiction.&& it’s a great idea to have a plot. it will coordinate your thoughts and add consistency to the text..&& 34. pedro edit your older articles and pieces. you will notice that great part of it will be crap.&& and it will allow you to refine your style and avoid mistakes that you used to make..&& want to improve your english in five minutes a day?

good reading comes from good writings. people read what they value. they reject and purge what they view as being boring.&& or useless.&& or vain.&& or disgusting trash!.&& a good writer knows what people value.&& and like.&& and love! write something valuable in a way that appeals and penetrates into hearts.&& minds and souls. people will love you for it!.&& wishing you all better reading from better writing.&& rac.&& another aspect that a writer should be conscience of.&& especially young writers.&& is to write what comes to you. don’t just abandon an idea because you think it might be shot down by whomever reads it. write for yourself.&& as if you’ll be the only one reading it.&& and you’ll find that your topics and styles are easier to relate to..&& i can’t believe you posted that comment from daniel! he actually talked about the importance of puncutuation but he misused a semi-colon. that should have been a comma!!!.&& great tips on writing…. when i write i imagine as if i’m speaking to my close friends.&& nice post! thank you so much…this will definitely help me in my quest for stardom!.&& i have seen people preferring informal writing and even speaking in times. it might be good in some point of time.&&for.&& it save most of our time in writing long sentence. but.&& the best part of writing formal writing and sticking to it is that.&& you will know your depth of writing standard..&& read as much as you can.&& for.&& a good writer is a good reader. try new vocabulary.&& find its synonyms.&& and antonyms. use them and try to find difference even between their synonyms..&& thank you.&&.&& three more tips:.&& throw away your thesaurus.&& read books you normally wouldn’t read.&& write actively.&& ditch passivity..&& no one tip will ever work for everyone.&& what works for some just won’t work for others. experiment.&& experiment.&& experiment..&& i’ve been researching my family.&& and i am finding that there is alot of diffrenties between todays life and what my ancestors have done and i was thinking of writting a book. but i don.&&t know if there is a market for this kind of book..&& it is a wonderful and very useful site not only for me but also for all those who want to become a good writer. i want to become a good teacher of english language. please.&& help and guide me. i will be thankful to you for this favour..&& compare to reading.&& writing needs more vocabulary. to become a good writer one needs to be a good reader that improved vocabulary..&& informative site.&& thank you. writing is fun.&& especially after you corral your internal editor..&& danielle.&& great article and great tips. i will make sure to read them more then once and to apply most of them if not all..&& thanks!.&& regards.&&.&& zoran.&& your blog in general.&& and this post in particular.&& are great resources..&& thank you for sharing such valuable advice. are you on twitter?.&& roger.&& great points!.&& i particularly like number 10.&& ‘right click on a word to use the thesaurus. do it again on the new word and make the best use of your vocabulary.’.&& i think it is really important to build up as large a vocabulary as possible.&& this is a great way to get into the habit!.&& i am a thai hypnotherapist.&& if i write i can write about hypnosis or hypnotherapy or meditation. i am now 75 yeqrs old. in fact.&& i like reading more than writing.&& but i would like to try writing about my experiences since i was young until now if possible..&& boonlert saisanit.&& ph.d..&& well.&& to be a better writer.&& you should pursue the tips found in this blog. to be your own writer.&& follow the reverence of your mind… conformity.&& complacency.&& structure…they are mere pipe dreams of the still born human intellect. break from that.&& be audacious. no book or hymn will make you a true writer. no other can truly show you how you should write. and write with a tinge of gravity… write the implacable essence of your soul.&& whether it be effrontery.&& or mediocrity..&& you should take a break for a little while like focus a little on other things then when your done doing those activities ideas will start to flow instead of stressing over what you’re going to write about..&& this type of user generated content is really not a good source for information. there is a good manual called “tips for writers”.&& and some other books such as “the elements of style”.&& that really tell people: how to use punctuation properly.&& when to use capital letters.&& sentence structure.&& grammar.&& and much more..&& avoid cliches.&& and not just cliched phrases – the way a character reacts could be. if someone offered you a spider.&& would you recoil in horror? thought not..&& i need help with write what this words mean omit needles words.&& i need help with the discussion on /specific /measurable/ attainable /relevant /time-bound / how do i discussion the words in a statement ..&& how would i write this words abbreviation please help me please?.&& as a teacher.&& i am trilingual. i coach chinese.&& spanish and english in latin america..&& writing is a job i enjoy most. kindly give me more tips..&& lee.&& doing translation helps build writing skills..&& the one and only way to be a perfect writer is to:.&& read.&& read.&& read. write.&& write.&& write everyday!.&& .&& .&& .&& .&& copyright © 2007 - 2021 daily writing tips . all right reserved][34 writing tips that will make you a better writer, keep learning!

with your target reader in mind, express why your message is relevant and important. place your message in a context that allows your reader to connect in the first sentence. use words and terms that reveal the value your message will add to the life of your reader. do this in a refreshing, stimulating way. avoid using the drab and depressing phraes that are so common in the inferrior views of our rudest critics. as you express thoghts, comic relief is always appreciated, well if the person has a impish giggle nerve to tickle. insight is appreciated by those people who like to read an author resolve one or more of life’s perplexing emotional mysteries. people never tire of having or making more money, saving their time, enjoying better health, being more highly entertained or being delivered from that dreadful sense of boredom that often takes one captive by surprise or by the malicious intent of the people who write books on how to improve your writing style. writers will not argue that writing is the purest form of known communication. writing supercedes all other forms in its display of knowledge. it allows people to imagine a concept and then employ their intelligence and vivid imaginations to fill in the suggested blanks, or to wrestle the folly out of one’s brain. writing stimulates the mind; it waters the soul; it feeds the heart; and, it reveals and demolishes our enemy’s ploys like no other form of communication. writers and readers know how writing can start wars or propose peace. we know this intuitively. good writers create good reading! good reading comes from good writings. people read what they value. they reject and purge what they view as being boring, or useless, or vain, or disgusting trash! a good writer knows what people value, and like, and love! write something valuable in a way that appeals and penetrates into hearts, minds and souls. people will love you for it! wishing you all better reading from better writing, rac, hollyon november 24, 2008 1:55 pm another aspect that a writer should be conscience of, especially young writers, is to write what comes to you. don’t just abandon an idea because you think it might be shot down by whomever reads it. write for yourself, as if you’ll be the only one reading it, and you’ll find that your topics and styles are easier to relate to., alexandraon november 28, 2008 3:00 pm i can’t believe you posted that comment from daniel! he actually talked about the importance of puncutuation but he misused a semi-colon. that should have been a comma!!!, sanon january 02, 2009 2:06 pm great tips on writing…. when i write i imagine as if i’m speaking to my close friends, angelaon january 06, 2009 5:58 am nice post! thank you so much…this will definitely help me in my quest for stardom!, rajesh chaudharyon january 10, 2009 3:57 pm i have seen people preferring informal writing and even speaking in times. it might be good in some point of time,for, it save most of our time in writing long sentence. but, the best part of writing formal writing and sticking to it is that, you will know your depth of writing standard. read as much as you can, for, a good writer is a good reader. try new vocabulary, find its synonyms, and antonyms. use them and try to find difference even between their synonyms. thank you,, chrison january 25, 2009 6:06 am three more tips: throw away your thesaurus read books you normally wouldn’t read write actively, ditch passivity. no one tip will ever work for everyone, what works for some just won’t work for others. experiment, experiment, experiment., lisa raupachon january 31, 2009 10:53 pm i’ve been researching my family, and i am finding that there is alot of diffrenties between todays life and what my ancestors have done and i was thinking of writting a book. but i don,t know if there is a market for this kind of book., rana ismilon february 22, 2009 9:17 am it is a wonderful and very useful site not only for me but also for all those who want to become a good writer. i want to become a good teacher of english language. please, help and guide me. i will be thankful to you for this favour., jameel farooquion april 17, 2009 3:39 pm compare to reading, writing needs more vocabulary. to become a good writer one needs to be a good reader that improved vocabulary., danielleon may 06, 2009 1:32 pm informative site, thank you. writing is fun, especially after you corral your internal editor. danielle, zoranon may 21, 2009 1:14 pm great article and great tips. i will make sure to read them more then once and to apply most of them if not all. thanks! regards, zoran, roger c. parkeron june 25, 2009 12:21 am your blog in general, and this post in particular, are great resources. thank you for sharing such valuable advice. are you on twitter?
