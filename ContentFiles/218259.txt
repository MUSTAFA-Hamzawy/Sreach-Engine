[[unix; common], 1. something passed between routines or programs that enables the receiver to perform some operation; a capability ticket or opaque identifier. especially used of small data objects that contain data encoded in a strange or intrinsically machine-dependent way. e.g., on non-unix oses with a non-byte-stream model of files, the result of ftell(3) may be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to fseek(3), but not operated on in any meaningful way. the phrase it hands you a magic cookie means it returns a result whose contents are not defined but which can be passed back to the same or some other program later., 2. an in-band code for changing graphic rendition (e.g., inverse video or underlining) or performing other control functions (see also cookie). some older terminals would leave a blank on the screen corresponding to mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a glitch (or occasionally a turd; compare mouse droppings). see also cookie.][]magic cookie[][]
