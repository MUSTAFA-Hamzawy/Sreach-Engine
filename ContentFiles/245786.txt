[stay up to date on all things tezos.&& whats tezos?.&& the future of the internet is being built on tezos–with user participation and governance at its core. users can directly and frictionlessly interface with each other over a decentralized network.&& exchanging value and interacting with various applications.&& without the need for intermediaries. on tezos.&& web3 can be a truly user-governed and user-centric movement.&& the way it was meant to be..&& tezos is designed to provide the safety and code correctness required for assets and other high value use cases at both the protocol and application layers by leveraging languages ocaml and michelson.&& which facilitate formal verification.&& a practice commonly used in mission-critical industries. the future of web3 can be secure on tezos..&& the tezos platform was built with mechanisms to ensure active community governance and participation–a key component of web3. users can actively participate by evaluating.&& proposing.&& or approving amendments to tezos. this empowers the type of collaborative innovation that keeps tezos on the bleeding edge of technology.&& and it’s why tezos is best positioned to underpin the web3 revolution..&& unlike proof-of-work blockchains like bitcoin or ethereum.&& tezos’ proof-of-stake requires significantly less energy and cost to operate.&& making it an ideal alternative platform for building blockchain applications that are eco-friendly. as the web3 movement gains in adoption.&& scaling responsibly requires a more energy-efficient approach. tezos delivers on this today..&& tezos is one of the leading smart contracts proof of stake blockchains. tezos smart contracts can use formal verification.&& allowing them to be mathematically verified.&& reliable.&& and secure..&& tezos is built to adjust.&& adapt.&& and add features and functionality through its proven on-chain upgrade mechanism..&& tezos is built to remain state-of-the-art. its modular architecture and formal upgrade mechanism minimizes disruptions while offering regular upgradability and enhanced functionality over time..&& meet tezos.&& tezos is an open-source platform that addresses key barriers facing blockchain adoption for assets and applications backed by a global community of validators.&& researchers.&& and builders. by design.&& tezos embraces long-term upgradability.&& open participation.&& collaboration.&& and smart contract safety..&& tez (xtz) is the native token of the tezos blockchain. it is used to interact with dapps.&& pay for fees.&& secure the network through staking.&& and provide a basic accounting unit on the tezos platform..&& tez (xtz) price.&& powered by tzkt api.&& upgrade timeline.&& tezos continuously adds the latest

future..&& coming soon.&& jakarta.&& a new proposal has been submitted and is being evaluated and considered by the community..&& .&& introduced tenderbake.&& a new and significantly upgraded tezos consensus algorithm.&& which enables fast finality and improved scalability for the tezos blockchain. introduced a variety of other changes that improve the baking experience.&& such as reducing the amount of tokens required to be a validator.&& a rework of the baking and endorsement rewards mechanism.&& and more..&& introduced several improvements such as views which give smart contracts the ability to read the storage state of other smart contracts.&& timelock encryption to serve as a countermeasure against block producer extractable value.&& caching to provide faster access at lower gas costs to data that is accessed regularly.&& and a global table of constants to facilitate development of more complex smart contracts..&& introduced liquidity baking.&& which mints a small amount of tez every block and deposits it inside of a constant product market making smart-contract. this incentivizes large amounts of decentralized liquidity between tez and tzbtc. included several improvements that led to a 3-6x decrease in gas consumption of popular contracts..&& doubled maximum size of operations.&& which more than doubled the maximum size of smart contracts. furthered gas optimizations as well as sped up gas arithmetic by a factor of ten. enabled more intuitive smart contract development by adopting depth-first execution order. deactivated unused test chain in the economic protocol.&& resulting in more streamlined amendment process..&& added sapling and bls12-381 to enable privacy-preserving smart contracts and tickets for native permissions. updated amendment process by lowering period length to 5 cycles and adding a 5th adoption period..&& improved gas costs. reduced storage costs by a factor of 4 to reflect improvements in the underlying storage layer..&& increased gas limit per block and per operation; improved the accuracy and resiliency of the formula used for calculating baking and endorsing rewards..&& introduced a more robust version of the blockchain’s consensus algorithm (emmy+); simplified smart contract development; refined the delegation process..&& increased gas limit per block and reduced the roll size from 10.&&000 ꜩ to 8.&&000 ꜩ.&& careers.&& tezos is the product of many organizations across the globe working together on an open-source project. don’t see the perfect role for you but want to work on tezos? reach out
