community in a time when many were feeling disconnected. what started as an online fitness platform quickly transformed into the hybrid.&& in-person.&& and virtual cycling and high intensity interval training (hiit) program that is now hustle..&& together with her co-founding instructor.&& lorenzo mcfarland.&& and a strong team of individuals.&& miller started looking for a permanent home for her fitness studio about a year ago..&& “we were thrilled when amazon approached hustle with the opportunity to open our first brick-and-mortar location in met park at hq2.&&” said miller. “i am honored to be a part of this project highlighting women- and minority-owned local businesses. with hard work and consistency.&& anything is possible—we can’t wait to show that to the community at hq2.”.&&

improving the local communities in which it operates..&& “we had been following the news around amazon coming to arlington and knew this would be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to serve one of our home communities.&&” said souza..&& arlington had a rich bicycling culture before amazon committed to building and expanding bicycling infrastructure and accessibility in the area.&& including the construction of more than half a mile of new.&& protected bike lanes to help expand and enhance existing bike routes.&& and more than 900 interior and exterior bike storage stalls across hq2. conte and souza were especially attracted by amazon’s commitment to encouraging employees to ride bikes to work and be more conscious about sustainability.&& and they wanted to be a part of that offering for the community..&& “conte’s and metropolitan park fit together like a hand in a glove.&&” said conte. “we believe this will be a great place to share our passion to transform people’s lives through cycling and to further perpetuate our niche.&& which is bringing the cycling experience to virginia since 1957.”.&& .&& denise lee immigrated to the u.s. from the philippines in 1998. growing up in a

inspiration in a friday night tradition..&& “my husband and our two boys would go out for burgers.&& and i always thought.&& ‘i could do this—create a funky neighborhood spot with great burgers.&&’” she said..&& lee built social burger in vienna—a small community about 12 miles from arlington—and giving back to her community is core to her philosophy as a business owner..&& “every wednesday.&& we donate 40 meals that customers have purchased to the lamb center.&& a local homeless shelter in fairfax.&&” said lee. “since 2020.&& we’ve provided more than 6.&&000 meals to people in need. if we’re successful at hq2.&& we can make programs like this grow.”.&& bringing a great burger to the community is important.&& but there’s something even more important to lee..&& “there is so much dignity in
