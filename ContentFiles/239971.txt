[guest post by: tricia dean.&& tech services manager at wilmington public library district (il).&& this post is part of a series written by members of the community webs program. community webs advances the capacity for community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories and underrepresented voices. for more information.&& visit communitywebs.archive-it.org/.&& i was excited when i saw the call for participants in community webs. while wilmington.&& illinois is a small.&& rural town (5.&&664 people).&& the thought was that we still had something to contribute. most archive-it partners are universities.&& museums and large libraries.&& and being in their company was a little daunting to me initially. other institutions have someone who opens the project.&& and then it develops into a larger team project. wilmington public library district (wpld) has a much smaller staff; the project has been wholly mine.&& which has been both thrilling and terrifying. .&& wilmington is a small rural town.&& falling on the lower end of the economic scale.  because we are isolated.&&the library plays a vital part in the community.  we offer the usual storytimes and adult programs.&& but also loan out hotspots and chromebooks. we have 45 hotspots and these are almost always checked out; some people are using them for vacations.&& but by usage it is apparent that others are using them as their primary means of connecting to the internet. internet access has been more and more important.&& but after the covid-19 broke out.&& more governmental services went strictly online.&& making access even more critical – and to many who had not been regular patrons. wpld is a hub for the community.&& offering computers.&& information.&& tax forms.&& and a place to come in and chat – even more important when we are trying to stay close and limit outside contact..&& i am a chicago native who went to champaign-urbana for grad school. i was a scanner for the internet archive for several years where i was privileged to handle some incunabula (pre-1500 items). i am the technical services supervisor at wilmington; primarily i catalog our materials.&& but i also tend toward projects.&& from adding series labels to re-orienting all the calls in the juvenile non-fiction section.  i am currently going through our attic to help determine what we have (it’s a mystery!). i’m making lists.&& and hoping to have items to scan which would be available online.&& in multiple places. i applied for the community webs program (with my director’s blessing) because i felt that it’s important for small towns to be represented in the collection of history. only 20% of the population still lives outside major metro areas.&& but it is every bit as important to capture that life as it is to retain the history of large cities..&& wilmington library joined community webs in the summer of 2021. after some technical clarifications with the archive-it staff wlpd was set up. in considering what made wilmington unique.&& the first link was to our library and social media pages. social media has grown in importance in the last twenty years.&& but it became a vital link during covid when services were otherwise unavailable. wilmington library youtube videos.&& how-tos.&& crafts and storytime.&& stand to remind us of how we responded and as a continuing reference for parents who can’t get to the library. but since social media.&& specifically.&& is known for ‘right now.&&’ it lacks the kind of reflection over time that we can create through the community webs project..&& we may be small.&& but we have a number of historical articles and sites which needed to be brought together. we want to reflect events that have been impactful to our community.&& from the explosion of the joliet armory in the 1940s to the continuing issues with the wilmington dam.&& which has proved dangerous.&& but has complicated ownership issues. i still have a long way to go; the projects (attic/local history/web archive) are all intertwined. wilmington has the usual community resources and city government collections in archive-it. going forward.&& we want to continue to develop our wilmington history collection. we are working on local history and will establish a collection of materials from our attic and public donations. our local paper has vertical files which could be a goldmine of information – again.&& on my to-do list.  we will be kicking off an oral history project.&& which will begin with a series of simple gatherings/coffee hours for our seniors.&& providing a place for them to gather.&& and a space to share their stories. i am hoping these will be in our community webs archive. who better to speak to where we’ve been and where we are than some of our oldest residents?.&& why is community webs important? because it will help to remember when we cannot keep up with the information overload. because there is so much happening that we miss a good deal of what is around us – or can’t bear to face it for long. because so very very much of our lives are now online – and can be erased with a keystroke. because we are seeing.&& painfully.&& that those who do not learn from the past will be/are condemned to re-live it. and.&& for wilmington.&& i think it is important because so many of the voices and sites being captured are from museums.&& universities and large public libraries. it is important that we remember that we used to be far less urban than we are today. it is important to remember the smaller places.&& those who are too easily lost in the maelstrom of modern life.&& because to be forgotten is to be erased..&& guest post by: inuit circumpolar council alaska.&& this post is part of a series written by members of internet archive’s community webs program. community webs advances the capacity for community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories and underrepresented voices. for more information.&& visit communitywebs.archive-it.org/.&& can you describe your community and the services and role of your organization within the community?.&& inuit circumpolar council (icc) alaska works on behalf of the inupiat of the north slope.&& northwest and bering straits regions; st. lawrence island yupik; and the central yup’ik and cup’ik of the yukon-kuskokwim region in southwest alaska. icc alaska is a national member of icc international. since inception in 1977.&& icc has gained consultative status ii with the united nations.&& and is a permanent participant of the arctic council..&& for example.&& icc has provisional status with the international maritime organization (imo).&& is an active member at the arctic council senior level and within the working groups and is a prominent voice at the un framework convention on climate change (unfccc). work and engagement occur in many ways at these different fora. within the unfccc.&& icc has taken a leadership role in putting forward indigenous knowledge and establishing a platform for providing equitable space for multiple knowledge systems. additionally.&& at the unfccc cop 26.&& icc chair.&& dr. dalee sambo dorough.&& led an icc delegation made up of inuitrepresentatives from across the arctic..&& an immense amount of work occurs in direct partnership with inuit communities to inform work at international fora. for example.&& icc is facilitating the development of international protocols for equitable and ethical engagement. these protocols will provide a pathway to success for all that want to work within inuit homelands and whose work impacts the arctic. the protocols will aid in a paradigm shift in how work.&& decisions.&& and policies are currently created and carried out. the paradigm shift will lead toward greater equity and recognition of inuit sovereignty and self-determination..&& why was your organization interested in participating in community webs? .&& the community webs program was attractive to icc because it provided the training and the storage to effectively preserve icc’s digitized & born-digital archival materials. we were pleased to see this offering as a solution for an ongoing desire to archive the prolific organization’s digital materials & products. this work dovetails nicely with icc alaska’s efforts to digitize 47 boxes.&& or around 80 linear feet of material that span 6 decades.&& including audio.&& film.&& photographic media.&& and paper documents..&& icc jam – part 2 – greenland.&& cultural programming as part of the 1983 general assembly. in this clip.&& view performances from greenland’s tuktak theater and a greenlandic choir.&& icc advocates for inuit and inuit way of life.&& highlighted by icc’s general assembly meetings. the icc receives its mandate from a general assembly held every four years. the general assembly is the heart of the organization.&& providing an opportunity for sharing information.&& discussing common concerns.&& debating issues.&& and strengthening the unity between all inuit across our homelands. through the community webs project.&& icc alaska has been able to preserve archival video of the icc general assemblies going back 30 years using archive-it and the internet archive.&& as well as all newsletters.&& press releases.&& resolutions.&& social media campaigns.&& and reports published on its website. these are a significant record of icc advocacy.&& but more importantly.&& inuit political and cultural heritage..&& why do you think it is important for public libraries.&& community archives.&& and other local and community-based organizations to do this work?.&& community-based organizations are uniquely positioned as both a part of and apart from the community. this vantage point allows for the self-reflection and observation needed for web archiving.&& as well as the relationships within the community to create the space and dialogue needed for community archiving projects. by building more capacity within community-based organizations for web archiving and digital preservation efforts.&& we can expand the recorded historical narrative and humanities-based inquiries in a multitude of directions.&& to truly reflect the diversity of our world & time..&& where do you hope to see your web archiving program going?.&& the core goal of this work is to make icc documents and its historical narrative more accessible and discoverable within icc.&& to icc’s member organizations.&& international bodies.&& and researchers.&& our aspirations are much bigger. our hope is that this web archive goes beyond the core goal to inspire.&& delight.&& hearten.&& inform.&& and add depth to the conversations inuit are having about cultural identity.&& relationship to the land.&& hunting.&& advocacy.&& self-determination.&& and self-governance. .&& we are curious about the intangible outcomes: what new work does the archive inspire? how does the archive add depth & historical weight to existing projects.&& discussions.&& and advocacy? what stories and knowledge gets re-remembered.&& or re-investigated after viewing archival materials? what advocacy.&& ethics.&& and philosophical works come from inuit leaders informed by the legacy that the archive shared? are youth leaders interested in adding to the archive?.&& is there anything you would like your organization to contribute back to the broader community of web archiving and/or local history in the form of documentation.&& workflows.&& policy drafts or other resources?.&& we have several aspirations. firstly.&& it is the telling of inuit stories. the archive is another manifestation of that mission – to record and share inuit voices across time. to increase access to those voices.&& information.&& knowledge.&& and history. the icc archival holdings are a historically unique & culturally significant telling of inuit cultural heritage.&& history (including political history).&& educational pedagogy.&& philosophy.&& self-determination.&& values.&& ethics.&& environmental stewardship.&& and indigenous knowledge. it is important to create a way for inuit to discover and interact with this work. community webs has offered a new tool in our toolkit..&& secondly.&& the goal is to move forward conversations about categorization and information management for indigenous communities. what does that look like in best practice? can we.&& together with other inuit archives.&& improve on existing practices to create a more equitable and ethical engagement with inuit-produced information.&& the management of that information.&& and the discovery and access of that information..&& what are you most excited to learn through your participation in community webs?.&& it was exciting to discover that many inuit and alaska native resources that have already been preserved using the internet archive. these resources are often affected by insufficient financial support. being able to have a preserved and accessible copy of these resources is an important step towards creating the bigger picture of the historical record of inuit advocacy. as part of the community webs meetings.&& it was exciting to hear from other tribal librarians and community archivists across the country & world. additionally.&& it was exciting to hear from speakers whose work informs our community archival work at icc alaska – such as chaitra powell who created (among other amazing things) the “archive in a backpack” project..&& what impact do you think web archiving could have within your community?.&& hopefully this work inspires other organizations to also preserve their digital assets.&& creating a richer narrative of inuit political and cultural heritage..&& what do you foresee as some of the challenges you may face?.&& we are eager to preserve our social media channels that have replaced the drum newsletter as a vehicle for keeping our community up-to-date on icc’s work. ongoing challenges with facebook and instagram archiving are preventing us from doing that. hopefully these issues are resolved in the favor of the communities who created the content and bring their community and connections to these software platforms..&& the covid-19 pandemic has been life-changing for people around the globe. as efforts to slow the progress of the virus unfolded in early 2020.&& librarians.&& archivists and others with interest in preserving cultural heritage began considering ways to document the personal.&& societal.&& and systemic impacts of the global pandemic. these collections  included preserving physical.&& digital and web-based information and artifacts for posterity and future research use. .&& in response.&& the internet archive’s archive-it service launched a covid-19 web archiving special campaign starting in april 2020 to allow existing archive-it partners to increase their web archiving capacity or new partners to join to collect covid-19 related content. in all.&& more than 100 organizations took advantage of the covid-19 web archiving special campaign and more than 200 archive-it partner organizations built more than 300 new collections specifically about the global pandemic and its effects on their regions.&& institutions.&& and local communities. from colleges.&& universities.&& and governments documenting their own responses to community-driven initiatives like sonoma county library’s sonoma responds community memory archive.&& a variety of information has been preserved and made available. these collections are critical historical records in and of themselves.&& and when taken in aggregate will allow researchers a comprehensive view into life during the pandemic..&& we have been exploring with partners ways to provide unified access to hundreds of individual covid-related web collections created by archive-it users. when the institute of museum and library services launched the american rescue plan grant program.&& that was part of the broader american rescue plan.&& a $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed into law on march 11.&& we applied and were awarded funding  to build a covid-19 web archive access portal – a dedicated search and discovery access platform for covid-19 web collections from hundreds of institutions.  the covid-19 web archive will allow for browsing and full text search across diverse institutional collections and enable other access methods.&& including making datasets and code notebooks available for data analysis of the aggregate collections by scholars.  this work will support scholars.&& public health officials.&& and the general public in fully understanding the scope and magnitude of our historical moment now and into the future. the covid-19 web archive is unique in that it will provide a unified discovery mechanism to hundreds of aggregated web archive collections built by a diverse group of over 200 libraries from over 40 us states and several other nations.&& from large research libraries to small public libraries to government agencies. if you would like your archive-it collection or a portion of it included in the covid-19 web archive.&& please fill out this interest form by friday.&& april 29.&& 2022. if you are an institution in the united states that has covid-related web archives collected outside of archive-it or internet archive services that you are interested in having included in the covid-19 web archive.&& please contact covidwebarchive@archive.org..&& to celebrate national library week 2022.&& we are taking readers behind the scenes to meet the librarians who work at the internet archive and in associated programs..&& in the spring of 2021.&& catherine falls was hired by the internet archive to launch the community webs program in canada. she was excited about the prospect of helping public libraries.&& museums.&& local historical societies and archives digitally preserve important material. .&& “most web archiving happens at really large institutions.&& so much of the experience of local communities is missing from the historic record. it’s giving us a biased view of contemporary society.&&” falls said. “the more of these local organizations that we can get to do this archiving.&& the more the historic record will be brought into balance.”.&& since her efforts began.&& the internet archive has partnered with 43 institutions and organizations in canada to build community-based collections. falls said it’s been rewarding to follow the growth and variety of web-archiving projects . for example.&& the milton public library in ontario is working with the halton black history awareness society and other organizations to document items that may not otherwise be captured on the web. meanwhile.&& the arquives: canada’s lgbtq2+ archives is working with its community members to build web archive collections that capture the community’s web presence..&& falls earned  bachelor’s degrees in commerce and art history from the university of british columbia. she also has a master’s degree in library science and a master’s degree in art history from the university of toronto. before coming to the internet archive.&& she worked as an archivist in canada at several institutions including york university and the archives of ontario..&& “i’m interested in the free circulation of ideas and the library as a place where public knowledge is accessible.”.&& “i was drawn to libraries as a kind of place that facilitates research–which for me is the most exciting phase of any project.&&” falls said. “i’m interested in the free circulation of ideas and the library as a place where public knowledge is accessible. i like how the intellectual possibilities of a library intersect with the library as a community space.”.&& falls says her background gives her a solid understanding of the basic functions of the library and the common language used within the profession. with that theoretical grounding.&& she said she can approach her work from a critical perspective to make improvements. .&& “it’s important to keep in mind that libraries are not infallible institutions. we need to be constantly questioning our practice and finding ways to be better.&&” falls said. “it’s easy to say libraries are these beautiful.&& idyllic institutions. but i think it’s healthy to take a critical eye toward the work we do so that we can try to live up to our ideals in terms of whose stories we tell.&& who has access to our services.&& and what is preserved for the long term.” .&& falls said she enjoys the mission-driven focus of the internet archive. operating in the library.&& technology and archival world.&& it has a dynamic.&& nimble culture that provides fertile ground in which to explore new ideas.&& she said. .&& falls’ favorite holdings are among some of the quirkier arts-related web archive collections in the internet archive: university of michigan.&& school of information.&& 20th century minimalist music.&& dalhousie university.&& artist-run centres in halifax.&& nova scotia.&& and corning museum of glass.&& contemporary glass podcasts..&& in celebration of national library week.&& we’d like to introduce you to some of the professional librarians who work at the internet archive and in projects closely associated with our programs. over the next two weeks.&& you’ll hear from librarians and other information professionals who are using their education and training in library science and related fields to support the internet archive’s patrons..&& what draws librarians to work at the internet archive? from patron services to collection management to web archiving.&& the answers are as varied as the departments in which these professionals work. but a common theme emerges from the profiles—that of professionals wanting to use their skills and knowledge in support of the internet archive’s mission: “universal access to all knowledge.”.&& we hope that over these next two weeks you’ll learn something about the librarians working behind the scenes at the internet archive.&& and you’ll come to appreciate the training and dedication that influence their daily work. we’re pleased to help you “meet the librarians” during this national library week and beyond:.&& guest post by: olivia radbill.&& adult services/local history librarian.&& south pasadena public library.&& this post is part of a series written by members of internet archive’s community webs program. community webs advances the capacity for community-focused memory organizations to build web and digital archives documenting local histories and underrepresented voices. for more information.&& visit communitywebs.archive-it.org/.&& the south pasadena public library (sppl) is a single branch library system located in the small city of south pasadena.&& california.&& just fifteen minutes from downtown los angeles. sppl serves a population of approximately 25.&&000 residents.&& many of whom are very dedicated to preservation and local history. as the adult services/local history librarian at sppl.&& i regularly interact with local organizations.&& city staff.&& city commissioners.&& and residents in search of the many little-known details of south pasadena’s history. my role not only entails organizing.&& processing.&& and making accessible local history.&& but also archiving current events that will inevitably be the subject of future research. .&& at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic.&& when the sppl building was first shut down and our physical local history collection made inaccessible.&& library staff sought to provide means of bringing local history to digital platforms in a consistent and manageable way. our first means of public outreach was through the creation of digital exhibits using arcgis storymaps.&& an interactive web-mapping tool used to host narrative multimedia displays. exhibits in the series include ray bradbury: celebrating 100 years.&& south pasadena public library: twelve decades and counting.&& city of trees: our urban tree canopy.&& summers in sopas: highlights of summers past.&& and covid-19: living history project. to date.&& this series has garnered thousands of views..&& while this series did quell some of the community desire to interact with the local history collection.&& it did not address the needs of the community in regards to born-digital content. the covid-19 pandemic highlighted certain gaps in our collection. one of the most notable gaps was the lack of any born-digital or web-archived content. previously.&& sppl has relied primarily on physical donations and physical city documentation. however.&& once these objects became inaccessible to both library staff and patrons during our initial covid-19 closure in march 2020.&& we sought means of preserving documentation that has increasingly moved to exclusively web-based platforms. for example.&& in april 2020 the city of south pasadena launched “city hall scoop”.&& an online blog intended to provide quick.&& reliable news updates to local residents. it became imperative for library staff to actively seek out and ensure preservation of this kind of content. .&& at the onset of our involvement in the community webs program.&& i strove to ensure that the objective of our internet archiving was specific.&& consistent.&& and attainable. after careful consideration.&& the following categories were determined to be priorities to the sppl local history collection: city government.&& local newspapers.&& and nonprofit organizations. based on these categories we have identified many relevant websites.&& but chose to focus primarily on official websites and social media pages.&& to add to the archive-it platform. the community webs project has been an invaluable resource for addressing the needs of both the sppl staff and the community. online trainings have aided significantly in overcoming learning curves.&& helped us determine the scope of our archiving project.&& and have allowed sppl to create a system in which web-based content is an integral part of our local history collection. sppl.&& as of march 2022.&& has archived.&& either singularly or on a recurring basis.&& eleven websites. we are hoping to archive 22 new sites by the end of the year.&& doubling the number we reached last year. .&& earlier this summer.&& the internet archive announced its partnership with the new york art resources consortium (nyarc) to form a collaborative.&& web-based art resources preservation and access initiative. we are now thrilled to announce that the initiative has kicked off with a diverse roster of 24 participating member institutions throughout the united states and canada..&& the collaborative art archive (carta) project has a mission to collect.&& preserve.&& and provide access to vital arts content from the web by supporting a vibrant.&& growing collaboration of art and museum libraries. with funding from federal agencies and foundations.&& the internet archive is able to expand carta to a diverse set of museums and art libraries worldwide and to broaden the ways the resulting collections can be discovered and used both by scholar and patrons..&& the arts institutions actively participating in this program so far include:.&& membership in the program includes national and regional art and museum libraries throughout the united states and canada committed to the preservation of 21st century art historical resources on the web. one of our early supporters and current carta member amelia nelson.&& director of library and archives at the nelson-atkins museum of art.&& noted the increased risk of losing art history on the web in comparison to earlier generations of artists: “websites are the letters.&& exhibition postcards.&& exhibition reviews and newspaper articles of today’s artists and artistic communities.&& but they aren’t resources that scholars can find in archives like the physical materials that document the careers of earlier generations of artists. i worry that as we lose these sites.&& we are also losing the potential for scholars to place this moment in the canon of art history and culture broadly. this initiative will build a collaborative and sustainable way for art libraries to pool their limited resources.&& with the technical.&& administrative.&& and organizational expertise of the internet archive.&& to ensure that this content is available for future generations.”.&& the initial group of member institutions have identified an initial set of more than 150 valuable and at-risk websites.&& articles.&& and other materials on five primary collection topics: local arts organizations; artists websites; art galleries; auction houses (catalogs/price lists); and art criticism.  these collections will continue to grow and evolve over the course of the project.&& capturing thousands of websites and many terabytes of data. .&& we’re actively seeking more us-based arts institutions to participate in the project as we continue to grow our collections of web-based art history resources. collaborative members attend meetings every two months to coordinate curation and other group activities as well as participate in subcommittees focused on collection development.&& metadata.&& end-user/researcher engagement.&& and outreach. if you are involved with an art and/or museum library interested in joining this collaborative project.&& please complete this form..&& community webs.&& the internet archive’s community history web and digital archiving program.&& is welcoming over 60 new members from across the us.&& canada.&& and internationally. this new cohort is the first expansion of the community webs program outside of the united states and we are thrilled to be supporting the development of diverse.&& community-based web collections on an international scale. .&& community webs empowers cultural heritage organizations to collaborate with their communities to build web and digital archives of primary sources documenting local history and culture.&& especially collections inclusive of voices typically underrepresented in traditional memory collections. the program achieves this mission by providing its members with free access to the archive-it web archiving service.&& digital preservation and digitization services.&& and technical support and training in topics such as web archiving.&& community outreach.&& and digital preservation. the program also offers resources to support a local history archiving community of practice and to facilitate scholarly research..&& new community webs member karen ng.&& archivist at sḵwx̱wú7mesh úxwumixw (squamish nation).&& bc.&& canada.&& notes that the program offers a way to capture community-generated online content in a context where many of the nation’s records are held by other institutions. “the squamish nation community is active in creating and documenting language.&& traditional knowledge.&& and histories. now more than ever in the digital age.&& it is imperative that these stories and histories be captured and stored in accessible ways for future generations.” .&& similarly.&& for maryna chernyavska.&& archivist at the kule folklore centre in edmonton.&& canada.&& the program will allow the centre to continue building relationships with community members and organizations. “being able to assist local heritage organizations with web archiving will help us empower these communities to preserve their heritage based on their values and priorities.&& but also according to professional standards.”.&& the current expansion of the program was made possible in part by generous funding from the andrew mellon foundation.&& which supports the growth of community webs to new public libraries in the us. additional funding provided by the internet archive allows the program to reach cultural heritage organizations in canada and beyond. this newest cohort brings the total number of participants in community webs to over 150 organizations.&& a ten-fold increase since the program’s inception in 2017. for a full list of new participants.&& see below. the program continues to add members – if your institution is interested in joining.&& please view our open calls for applications and please make your favorite local memory organization aware of the opportunity..&& programming for the new cohort is underway and these members are already diving into the program’s educational resources and familiarizing themselves with the technical aspects of web archiving and digital preservation. we kicked things off recently with introductory zoom sessions.&& where participants met one another and shared their organizations’ missions.&& communities served and goals for membership in the program. online training modules.&& developed by staff at the internet archive and the educopia institute.&& went live for new members at the beginning of september. and our new cohort joined our existing community webs partners at our virtual partner meeting on september 22nd. .&& we are thrilled to see the program continuing to grow and we look forward to working with our newest cohort. a warm welcome to the following new community webs members!.&& congrats to these new partners! we are excited to have you on board..&& much of the art gallery.&& artist.&& and arts organization materials that were once published in print form are now available primarily or solely on the web. these groups.&& like many in the cultural sector.&& have also been hit especially hard by the global pandemic.&& making their web presences particularly at-risk of being lost if they are not proactively collected and preserved.the creation of reference and research resources that promote streamlined access and enable new types of scholarly use will ensure that the art historical record of the 21st century.&& and especially of our current global pandemic.&& is readily accessible far into the future..&& for this reason.&& the internet archive.&& along with the new york art resources consortium (nyarc).&& are pleased to announce our project consortial action to preserve born-digital.&& web-based art history & culture. the project recently received a two-year.&& $305.&&343 humanities collections and reference resources grant from the division of preservation and access at the national endowment for the humanities. this award will support the formation of a cooperative group of 30+ art and museum libraries from across the united states to collaborate on the preservation of.&& and access to vital arts content from the web. .&& the internet archive has a long history of building and supporting collaborative communities and providing non-profit web.&& preservation.&& and access services to cultural heritage organizations. the multi-institutional initiative between internet archive.&& nyarc.&& and other arts and museum organizations will build on similar community-based archiving and professional cultivation projects in the community programs group.&& especially our community webs program.&& currently expanding nationally and internationally. community webs has received funding from the andrew w. mellon foundation and imls to provide public libraries and cultural heritage organizations with services.&& training.&& and professional development opportunities to document their diverse local history. .&& nyarc are pioneers in collaborative web archiving and shared services.&& among art and museum libraries. nyarc’s robust web archive collections encompass art resources.&& artists’ websites.&& auction catalogs.&& catalogues raisonnes.&& and hundreds of new york city gallery websites. the internet archive and nyarc have partnered on work to build born-digital collecting capacity among arts organizations in the past.&& most recently in the imls-funded advancing art libraries and curated web archives national forum and related events.  through discussions.&& workshops and roadmapping sessions with leaders in art and museum libraries.&& a strategy and plan  towards an inclusive.&& sustainable.&& cooperative approach to collecting and stewarding born-digital.&& locally-focused art history collection was developed.&& forming the basis of this broader cooperative effort..&& members in the project’s preliminary group of art and museum libraries will select topics and specific web content that is relevant to their expertise.&& will provide metadata to facilitate access to archived content.&& and will participate in planning and evaluation meetings.&& all while curating a valuable reference resource that will enhance their traditional collecting areas. the internet archive will coordinate communications.&& facilitate governance and collective curatorial activities.&& provide technical digital library and archive services.&& and help enable members to build and maintain discovery and access platforms.&& as well as facilitate researcher use of the collections resulting from the group’s work..&& if your art or museum library is interested in joining this collaborative effort.&& please fill out this participation form by july 31 to join us! .&& internet archive’s community webs program is delighted to announce a partnership with the digital public library of america (dpla) to ingest metadata from the over 700 publicly available community webs web archive collections into dpla. these collections include thousands of archived websites and millions of individual web-published resources that document local history and underrepresented groups. the internet archive has been a dpla content provider since 2015.&& primarily contributing content from our many print digitizing partnerships. community webs will also join dpla as a member and we are excited for this opportunity to add hyperlocal born-digital and web collections from public libraries nationwide into dpla’s national portal to cultural heritage collections..&& the community webs program was launched in 2017 to provide training.&& infrastructure.&& services.&& and professional community cultivation for public librarians across the country for the purpose of documenting local history and community archiving.&& especially documenting communities and populaces traditionally excluded from the historical record. the program is in the midst of nationwide expansion and currently includes more than 100 member public libraries who are collaborating with local organizations.&& movements.&& and groups to document the lives and accomplishments of their citizens. the program continues to add new public libraries and cultural heritage organizations to support and scale their community archiving and has an open call for applications in the us.&& canada.&& and internationally for additional public libraries and local heritage organizations to join the program. examples of community webs collections include:.&& working with a mission-aligned organization like dpla and our shared values of collaboration.&& open access.&& and community empowerment made it an obvious fit for community webs member collections to also be available in dpla. some public libraries who are a part of the community webs program are also members of local or statewide
