today..&& this was updated with some code to have the same feature set as before.&& as well as new:.&& here’s some before / after screenshots:.&& .&& every month.&& we look over the total download counts for all public items at archive.org.  we sum item counts into their collections.  at year end 2014.&& we found various source reliability issues.&& as well as overcounting for “top collections” and many other issues..&& .&& archive.org public items tracked over time.&& .&&  .&& .&& so we now treat <mediatype> tags like <collection> tags.&& in terms of counting.&& and unique all <collection> tags to avoid items w/ minor nonideal data tags and another kind of overcounting..&&  .&& we graph the “difference” between absolute downloads counts for the current month minus the prior month.&& for each month we have data for.  this gives us graphs that show downloads/month over time.  however.&& values can easily go *negative* with various scenarios (which is *wickedly* confusing to our poor users!).&& a collection has a really *hot* item one month.&& racking up downloads in a given collection.  the next month.&& a dmca takedown or otherwise removes the item from being available (and thus counted in the future).  the downloads for that collection can plummet the next month’s run when the counts are summed over public items for that collection again.  so that collection would have a negative (net) downloads count change for this next month!.&& use the current month’s collection “item membership” list for current month *and* prior month.  sum counts for all those items for both months.&& and make the graphed difference be that difference.  in just about every situation that remains.&& graphed monthly download counts will be monotonic (nonnegative and increasing or zero)..&&  .&&  .&& as mentioned in our recent building music libraries post.&& we are working with researchers at columbia university and upf in barcelona to run their code on the music collection to help their research and to provide new analyses that could help with exploration and understanding..&& we are doing some pilot runs to generate files which some close observers may see in the music item directories on archive.org.  audio fingerprints from audfprint are .afpt and music attributes from essentia are in _esslow.json.gz (download sample) and _esshigh.json.gz..&& .&& spectrogram of a grateful dead track.&& .&& we are also creating image files showing the audio spectrum used.  we hope this is useful for those that want to see if files have been compressed in the past (even if they are posted as flac files now).  there is also a .png for each audio file of a basic waveform that is being used in the archive’s beta site as eye candy..&& more as it happens.&& but we wanted you know there is some progress and you will see some new files.  if you have proposed other analyses that would benefit from being run over a large corpus.&& please let us know by contacting info at archive dot org..&& thank you to the researchers and the archive programmers who are working together to make this happen..&&  .&& the internet archive is working with partners to preserve our musical heritage. the music collections started 8 years ago with the etree.org live music recordings and grew when we started hosting netlabels..&& .&& scanning an lp cover.&& .&& now through new efforts and partnerships we have begun to expand and explore the music collections further.  we are working with researchers.&& record labels.&& collectors.&& internet communities and other archives to gather music media.&& build tools for preservation and expand metadata for exploration..&& we have already made tremendous progress. we have archived millions of tracks.&& we are working with the archive of contemporary music to digitize portions of their extensive collections of physical media.&& the musicbrainz.org community has provided meticulous metadata.&& and researchers from university programs have begun to analyze the music..&& .&& listening room.&& .&& a prototype “listening room” in the internet archive’s building in san francisco is available free to the public to listen to the full musical holdings.  access to these collections will also be provided to select computer science researchers via a secure “virtual reading room” in our data center.  as tools and the collections grow.&& we will offer everyone access to the metadata to help them explore.&& and then offer links to commercial sites for listening or purchasing..&& we invite interested people to participate:.&& archives. the internet archive and the archive of contemporary music in new york have started digitizing acm’s holdings with consistent.&& high quality.&& standards-based methods to build a scalable workflow.  we welcome other archives with similar projects.&& or who would like to help.  “digitizing our large physical collections is an important step for our archive to allow others to learn from this deep legacy.&&” said bob george.&& director of the archive of contemporary music.&& nyc..&& .&& digitizing cds at the archive of contemporary music.&& .&& collectors.  digitize.&& donate.&& or

donation of many thousands of lps to the internet archive to help with their projects and for the love of music.&&” bruce lyall.&& proprietor of recycled records..&& labels.  preserving a complete collection of everything published by a label is best done by or with the record label.  we would like to work with labels to get their releases archived and properly cataloged.  “the upcoming music libraries program continues the very work that enables our label.&& and the musicians who record for us.&& to bring the music of earlier times to audiences today. we are proud to participate in a tradition of preservation that has brought joy to so many through music.”  said david fox.&& co-founder of musica omnia..&& cataloging services.  commercial and non-commercial cataloging services can participate by making sure there are proper links from and to these collections.  the musicbrainz.org open.&& community-created catalog has already been very helpful..&& .&& commercial vendors and streaming services.  links from these collections to commercial services can help users buy and listen to full tracks.  these services might have valuable metadata as well that can help users

and the general public..&& researchers.&& historians.&& and music lovers.  annotate.&& organize.&& datamine.&& and surface music in the collections.&& and help us preserve those works not yet in the collections.  “access to a comprehensive archive of commercial music audio is the key missing link for research relating signal processing to listener behavior.&&” said daniel ellis.&& professor at columbia university.  by analyzing the rhythms.&& keys.&& instruments.&& and genres.&& researchers will help create more complete metadata and aid discovery..&& looking to the future.&& we hope to

that work.&& i made sure that my original/source file was:.&& when all of those are true.&& our system will automatically take:.&& and create:.&& that is our normal ~1000 kb/sec “derivative” video.&& as well as “filename.ogv”.&& the /details/ page will then see two playable mpeg-4 h.264 videos.&& and offer them both with the [hd] toggle button (seen once video is playing) allowing users to pick between the two quality levels..&& if you wanted to offer a *third* quality.&& you could do that with another ending like above but with otherwise the same requirements.  so you could upload:.&& and the toggle would show the three options:   1080p.&& 540p.&& 480p.&& you can update existing items if you like.&& and re-derive your items.&& to get multiple qualities present..&& happy hacking!.&&  .&&  .&&  .&& per some requests from our friends in the live music archive community….&& you can get any archive.org item downloaded to your local machine as a .zip file (that we’ve been doing for 5+ years!) but whereas before it would be all files/formats.&& now you can be pick/selective about *just* certain formats..&& we’ll put links up on audio item pages.&& minimally.&& but the url pattern is simple for any item. it looks like (where you replace identifier with the identifier of your item (eg: thing after archive.org/details/)):.&& http://archive.org/compress/identifier.&& for the entire

festival (2007-present) maryland: the shakemore music festival is an annual weekend event comprised of 20 to 30 acts, featuring frequent appearances from what has become a large shakemore family of bands (including bang bang lulu, caching behavior, cigarbox planetarium, go pills, weird paul rock band, and many others)., quantum leap podcast: the quantum leap podcast talks about every episode of the cult hit time travel program, as well as the novels and comic books it inspired., my morton grove – oral history interviews: a collection of oral history interviews conducted by morton grove public library in morton grove, illinois., much nicer cosmetic/look updates, nice “rewind 10 seconds” button, controls are now in an updated control bar, (video) ‘related items’ now uses the same (better) recommendations from the bottom of an archive.org /details/ page, airplay (safari) and chromecast basic casting controls in player, playback speed rate control now easier to use / set, playback keyboard control with space and left , right and up, down keys, (video) web vtt (captions) has much better user interface and display, flash is now only used to play audio/video if html5 doesnt work (flash does not do layout or controls now), rebuilt a new system to use our database (db) for item download counts, instead of our less reliable (and more prone to “drift”) solr search engine (se)., changed monthly saved data from json and php serialized flatfiles to new db table — much easier to use now!, fixed overcounting issues for collections: texts, audio, etree, movies, fixed various overcounting issues related to not unique-ing <collection> and <contributor> tags (more below), fixes to character encoding issues on <contributor> tags, we now track *all collections*.  previously, we only tracked items tagged: <mediatype> texts <mediatype> etree <mediatype> audio <mediatype> movies, <mediatype> texts, <mediatype> etree, <mediatype> audio, <mediatype> movies, for items we are tracking <contributor> tags (texts items), we now have a “contributor page” that shows a table of historical data., graphs are now “responsive” (scale in width based on browser/mobile width), in the below graph, mediatypes and collections are shown horizontally, with a sample “collection hierarchy” today., for each collection/mediatype, we show 1 example item, a b c and d, with a downloads/streams/views count next to it parenthetically.   so these are four items, spanning four collections, that happen to be in a collection hierarchy (a single item can belong to multiple collections at archive.org), the old way had a critical flaw — it summed all sub-collection counts — when really it should have just summed all *direct child* sub-collection counts (or gone with our new way instead), html5 is now the default — flash is a fallback option.  a final fallback option for most items is a “file download” link from the “click to play” image, videos have a nice new “related videos” pane that shows at the end of playback, should be much more reliable — i had previously hacked up a lot of the js and flash from the jwplayer release version to accommodate our various wants and looks — now we use mostly the stock player with minimal js alterations/customizations around the player., better hd video and other quality options — uploaders can now offer multiple video size and bitrate qualities.  if you know how to code web playable (see my next post!) h.264 mp4 videos especially, you can upload different qualities of our source video and the viewer will have to option to pick any of them (see more on that below)., more consistent ui and look and feel.  the longtailvideo team *really* cleaned up and improved their ui, giving everything a clean, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing look.  their default “skin” is also greatly improved, so we can use that now directly too, lots of cleaned up performance and more likely to play in more mobile, browsers, and and os combinations under the hood., h.264 video, aac audio, had the “moov atom” at the front (to allow instant playback without waiting to download entire file first) (search web for “qt-faststart” or ffmpeg’s “-movflags faststart” option, or see my next post for how we make our .mp4 here at archive.org), has a > 480p style hd width/height, has filename ending with one of:
