nelson, 2021) viewed at doc stories, at the 2021 san francisco international film festival. an utterly devastating documentary about the infamous 1971 upstate new york prison uprising. stanley nelson masterfully weaves together archival footage with contemporary interviews with survivors of the rebellion and the result is a haunting, incendiary indictment of the police and carceral state. this one stayed with me for a long time., la nuit des rois, (night of the kings, philippe lacôte, 2020) viewed at the 2021 sundance film festival. another film about inmates, this time set in the infamous maca prison in the ivory coast. the film is a fantastical, gritty, and gripping fable about creativity, survival and the power of storytelling. , faceless (jennifer ngo, 2021) viewed at the 2021 hawai’i international film festival. this documentary follows four anonymous participants in the 2019 hong kong protests as they demonstrate for the human rights of citizens in the city. watching the events documented a year or so after they occurred, with full knowledge of the ultimately futile demands of the protestors, is similar to watching attica. you know this doesn’t have a happy ending, but you can’t help rooting for the protagonists in their quixotic efforts. , balsinjehan (hard hit, kim jang-ju, 2021) tense and well-crafted, this film is everything you’d want from a south korean thriller and more. jo woo-jin is outstanding as an ordinary man suddenly facing a bomb crisis, who is forced to go to extremes to save his family from destruction. heartthrob ji chang wook plays against type as the obsessive antagonist who terrorizes a seemingly innocent family. along the way the film makes a cogent commentary about south korea’s crisis of compressed modernity. , zuk seoi piu lau (drifting, jun li, 2021) viewed at the 2021 international film festival rotterdam. jun li’s socio-conscious narrative follows several homeless denizens of hong kong as they attempt to retain some semblance of humanity and dignity despite the dire straits of their daily existence. anchored by francis ng’s stunning turn as the ex-con junkie big-eye fai, the film is an empathetic look at the forgotten street dwellers sleeping rough beneath hong kong’s glittering skyline., the sparks brothers (edgar wright, 2021) viewed at the 2021 south by southwest festival. emulating the cheeky and off-kilter attitude of its subjects, the documentary follows brothers russell and ron mael from their childhood in southern california through their long and winding musical career as pop duo sparks. i’ve always been a fan of sparks and their unique and twisted pop stylings, led by russell mael’s dramatic and operatic high tenor and ron mael’s sophisticated keyboards and songwriting. throughout the film, their wit and intelligence shine through., the velvet underground (todd haynes, 2021) i loved the way todd haynes remixed classic experimental movies and treated them like found footage. shirley clarke, maya deren, stan brakhage and many others are all part of the mashup. it’s hilarious, ironic and horrifying that he uses those films just like we 90s kids used old educational movies back in the day. to the average viewer, those clips may be just as anonymous and meaningless as educational films. but, some experimental film acolytes got a bit bent out of shape over the irreverence of it all. turnabout is fair play, i say., 7 days (roshan sethi, 2021), sau gyun jin (hand-rolled cigarette, chan kin long, 2020) , zeros and ones (abel ferrara, 2021), dangsin-eolgul-apeseo (in front
