[, , the google assistant sdk lets you add voice control, natural language understanding and google’s smarts to your ideas. your project captures an utterance (a spoken audio request, such as what's on my calendar?), sends it to the google assistant, and receives a spoken audio response in addition to the raw text of the utterance., the google assistant service exposes a low level api that lets you directly manipulate the audio bytes of an assistant request and response. bindings for this api can be generated for languages like node.js, go, c++, java for all platforms that support grpc., reference code is provided in python for audio capture, audio playback, and conversation state management., the following table summarizes the platform compatibility requirements of the google assistant service:, , , the sdk lets you build projects quickly by embedding the google assistant and then letting you add unique functionality with actions on google:, except as otherwise noted, the
