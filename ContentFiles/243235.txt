[pharmacogenetics.&& also called pharmacogenomics.&& is the study of how genes affect the bodys response to certain medicines. genes are parts of dna passed down from your mother and father. they carry information that determines your unique traits.&& such as height and eye color. your genes can also affect how safe and effective a particular drug could be for you..&& genes can be the reason the same medicine at the same dose will affect people in very different ways. genes may also be the reason some people have bad side effects to a medicine.&& while others have none..&& pharmacogenetic testing looks at specific genes to help figure out the types of medicines and dosages that may be right for you..&& other names: pharmacogenomics.&& pharmacogenomic testing.&& pharmacogenetic testing may be used to:.&& your health care provider may order these tests before you start a certain medicine.&& or if you are taking a medicine that is not working and/or causing bad side effects..&& pharmacogenetic tests are only available for a limited number of medicines. below are some of the medicines and genes that can be tested. (gene names are usually given in letters and numbers.).&& testing is usually done on blood or saliva..&& for a blood test.&& a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm.&& using a small needle. after the needle is inserted.&& a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. you may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. this usually takes less than five minutes..&& for a saliva test.&& ask your health care provider for instructions on how to provide your sample..&& you usually dont need any special preparations for a blood test. if you are getting a saliva test.&& you should not eat.&& drink.&& or smoke for 30 minutes before the test..&& there is very little risk to having a blood test. you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in.&& but most symptoms go away quickly..&& there is no risk to having a saliva test..&& if you were tested before starting a treatment.&& the test can show whether a medicine will likely be effective and/or if you are at risk for serious side effects. some tests.&& such as the ones for certain drugs that treat epilepsy and hiv.&& can show whether you are at risk for life-threatening side effects. if so.&& your provider will try to find an alternate treatment..&& tests that happen before and while youre on treatment can help your health care provider figure out the right dose..&& if you have questions about your results.&& talk to your health care provider..&& learn more about laboratory tests.&& reference ranges.&& and understanding results..&& pharmacogenetic testing is only used to find out a persons response to a specific medicine. it is not the same thing as genetic testing. most genetic tests are used to help diagnose diseases or potential risk of disease.&& identify a family relationship.&& or identify someone in a criminal investigation..&& the information on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice. contact a health care provider if you have questions about your health.][pharmacogenetic tests, what is pharmacogenetic testing?, what is it used for?, why do i need pharmacogenetic testing?, what happens during a pharmacogenetic test?, will i need to do anything to prepare for the test?, are there any risks to the test?, what do the results mean?, is there anything else i need to know about pharmacogenetic testing?, references, related health topics, related medical tests, medlineplus genetics]pharmacogenetic tests: medlineplus medical test[for a blood test,, for a saliva test,][health topics, drugs & supplements, genetics, medical tests, videos & tools, about medlineplus, about medlineplus, whats new, site map, customer support, health topics, drugs & supplements, genetics, medical tests, videos & tools, find out whether a certain medicine could be effective for you, find out what the best dosage might be for you, predict whether you will have a serious side effect from a medicine, hefti e, blanco j. documenting pharmacogenomic testing with current procedure terminology (cpt) codes, a review of past and present practices. j ahima [internet]. 2016 jan [cited 2018 jun 1];
