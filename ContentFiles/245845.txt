knowing when every game is has made sure i keep up to date with my teams. the notifications are helpful! they don’t take advantage of that.&& and you can set your preferences (when a match starts.&& when transfer news comes up.&& etc) which is helpful to me because i follow several teams in several leagues so it lets my keep up on all of them in a way i previously wasn’t able to. you can also follow individual players and leagues/tournaments. been recommending it and everyone loves it. if you’re a soccer fan.&& download it now.&& onefootball is my go to for everything soccer. it allows me to follow all my favorite teams (spurs.&& ne revs.&& usmnt.&& 3 lions) and leagues all in one space with solid updates.&& live ticker and breaking news. only a few small issues…the most infuriating is the bug that doesn’t give me any notifications for an entire week despite a reinstall. i woke up at 2am this morning to my phone dumping 100+ notifications from all the matches and league news. that needs to be fixed asap. other than that.&& it’s just minor details. more info on notifications about who scored or got the red and why. things like that. just polishing really. despite all that.&& it’s a 5 star app..&& the developer.&& onefootball gmbh.&& indicated that the app’s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below. for more information.&& see the developer’s privacy policy..&& the following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies:.&& the following data may be collected and linked to your identity:.&& the following data may be collected but it is not linked to your identity:.&& privacy practices may vary.&& for example.&& based on the features you use or your age. learn more.&& english.&& dutch.&& french.&& german.&& indonesian.&& italian.&& korean.&& polish.&& portuguese.&& russian.&& spanish.&& turkish.&& get all of your passes.&& tickets.&& cards.&& and more in one place..&& champions league official.&& fut 22 draft.&& builder - futbin.&& all football - scores & news.&& sofascore: live score app.&& fut 20 draft simulator.&& fc barcelona official app][onefootball - soccer news 17+, scores, stats & fixtures, onefootball gmbh, designed for ipad, screenshots, description, what’s new, ratings and reviews, amazing but there’s room for improvement, perfect app for fans who follow multiple teams!, the only app you’ll need…but could use an update, app privacy, data used to track you, data linked to you, data not linked to you, information, supports, wallet, you might also like]‎onefootball - soccer news on the app store[][global nav open menu global nav close menu, apple, shopping bag +, apple, store, mac, ipad, iphone, watch, airpods, tv & home, only on apple, accessories, support, , shopping bag +, #67 in sports, #67 in sports, 4.8 • 134.6k ratings, 4.8 • 134.6k ratings, free offers in-app purchases, free, offers in-app purchases, ipad, iphone, apple watch, , , , , , , , , , purchases, contact info, identifiers, usage data, purchases, contact info, user content, identifiers, usage data, other data, search history, diagnostics, levante vs espanyol $2.99, getafe vs sevilla fc $2.99, real madrid vs athletic club $2.99, villarreal vs leganés $2.99, real betis vs valencia $2.99, huesca vs eibar $2.99, deportivo alavés vs barcelona $2.99, atlético madrid vs valencia $2.99, levante vs real betis $2.99, sevilla fc vs rayo vallecano $2.99, developer website, app support, privacy policy, developer website, app support, privacy policy, wallet get all of your passes, tickets, cards, and more in one place.]
