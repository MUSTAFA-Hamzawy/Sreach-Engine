sleep, home office, kitchen, pets, safety & security, tools, travel, all home, sounds: the number and type of available sounds is likely the most important factor to consider. simple sound machines only offer white noise or fan sounds, but nicer sound machines usually have a handful of nature sounds as well. look at the included sounds and decide if it’s important to you to have lots of options. , volume: all sound machines have adjustable volume controls, but some have a narrow decibel range or a small, finite number of volume levels. if you plan to use the sound machine in a large space or in multiple environments, opt for a device with more adjustability., timer: all sound machines have an autoplay option, so they can play continuously until you turn them off. some sound machines also have a sleep timer, which means the sound will play for a given length of time and then automatically shut off. this is a nice feature if you just want sound at certain intervals of time., power: most sound machines plug in and require an outlet. however, if you’re buying a sound machine for travel, look for a battery-powered or rechargeable device. , appearance: sound machines are all generally small—around the size of an alarm clock—but some are larger or smaller depending on features and design. if you’re going to be using the sound machine for travel, you’ll want something small and portable. if the sound machine is going in an office, you may want something more elegant and discreet. , many sounds, robust sound, looks elegant, good warranty, headphone jack,
