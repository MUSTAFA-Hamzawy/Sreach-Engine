my write ups on writing are more focused on structure and persuasion.&& but i’m digging deep into the grammar technicalities. it’s fun to learn all these rules and structures! lol..&& i sent my comments through the contact button. if they don’t show up here in a little while.&& i will use this space to post them. basically i noted that “cleave” and “refrain” aren’t actually contranyms.&& because each is an example of two separate words which have always had separate meanings.&& but have acquired the same spelling..&& thank you brian for bringing that up. i also found that website.&& and i’d like to mention that “contronym” is perhaps not the best word for these difficult words. first.&& it might be.&& and perhaps should be.&& “contranym” with an “a” instead of an “o”. second.&& either way.&& it combines a prefix derived from latin with “nym” derived from greek. for that reason.&& i think “antagonym” is preferable because both parts are derived from greek..&& freud noticed an identical phenomenon in german in his essay “the uncanny.” “heimlich” has a secondary meaning synonymous with “unheimlich.” i also read somewhere that “guest” and “host” both come from the same indo-european root that means both.&& a word which also gave rise to the word “ghost.”.&& americans say we have a right to be tried by a jury of their peers. but a peer jury is the right of the british nobility to be tried by their peers (the house of lords). americans are only guaranteed a right by trial in front of an impartial jury since we don’t have peers..&& i would also be interested in words of single meaning that contradict themselves so should not be in the dictionary..&& for example.&& the word “indefinable” when applied.&& appears a blatant logical contradiction. it is an adjective. so it modifies a definable noun or pronoun. how can something definable be modified to something indefinable?.&& e.g. an indefinable terror. terror is definable since there are a finite list of terrors people can experience. so it can’t be indefinable..&& i wonder if this word should be allowed in the dictionary. contradictions can seriously deceive people..&& here’s another one:-.&& nothingness. it is a noun.&& hence the subject of a verb but nothingness cannot be anything except nothingness. it cannot be a noun.&& nor verb.&& nor any word at all. contradiction!.&& so this word must be a delusion. i don’t think it should be in the dictionary unless people like being deceived..&& my favorite is “pitch”.&& a double autoantonym. pitch can mean to actively promote or encourage acceptance of (i pitched my screenplay to the producer.).&& or to discard (that toner cartridge is empty. you should pitch it.) pitch can also mean a level surface (the soccer players have come out onto the pitch.).&& or a steep incline (the roofer charged me extra due to the steep pitch of my roof.).&& dictionary.com says the “all” version of “aught” means “at all.&& in any respect.&&” not an “omni-.” the two meanings of “consult” are not antonymic at all. that would be to receive advice or reject it. definitely on “quite.” its two meanings aren’t even close to antonymic..&& and.&& that’s just a brief bit of grammar police..&& let’s not over extend “a way with cuteness with words.”.&& i agree that “literally” to mean “virtually” is ridiculous..&& socraticgadfly has a point: some of these words are not contradictory.&& but complementary (lease.&& rent.&& etc.) the same word describes participation in either end of a transaction (much as.&& if i’m not mistaken.&& “prestar” means either “to borrow” or “to lend” in spanish.).&& i’m tempted to say that.&& strictly speaking.&& words that are not the same party of speech cannot be opposites.&& and to point out that “left” takes different auxiliary verbs in each of its “contrary” meanings — but i would risk being overly fussy and pedantic. 🙂.&& like sally.&& i too am from australia. however.&& i disagree with some of the meanings corrected by her..&& for instance.&& i would use the word ‘consult’ in both ways the article describes. many people i know.&& including myself.&& would say clip to cut/disconnect something and to join something together – not necessarily a clip(!). another example would be skin.&& it is used as a verb and a noun; transparent is arguable as well….&& i also believe a refrain.&& in music at least.&& is a repetition.&& sally..&& (and yes.&& i do realise that these comments are old…).&& thanks :>.&& you forgot outstanding… 1. excellent 2. unfinished or incomplete…outstanding debt.&& your work is outstanding! (excellent work.&& above average) you have outstanding work.&& please turn it in. (incomplete.&& unfinished ).&& after reading paul’s comments i wonder if maybe back in 2011.&& is it that back then he was just ignorant or a complete dumbass..&& there are obviously opposite words in addition to the same word meaning its opposite. yes you can clip something together or unclip it.&& however you can also remove something by clipping it..&& i’ve never heard of anyone unclipping their dog’s ears.&& only clipping them (just for paul: which means removing a portion of it)..&& ***.&& “literally [its opposite is not ‘literally’!]” this literally is the dumbest thing i have ever heard.&& because i literally just threw up in my mouth.&& literally..&& “mean [this is never excellent]”.&& what do you mean exactly? oh.&& exactly that?.&& presently [always means soon]”.&& except that i am presently working on tearing you down. i’m not going to do this soon.&& i am presently working on it.&& i might even stop and tell someone i am presently working on it and then come back to it and presume my present state of action..&& and finally.&& where did any of this say it was australian grammar. believe me when i say that within the states.&& there are differences in grammar and meaning of english words just from different regions. have you ever watch english tv and us tele? they use words all the time that mean a complete opposite to the other. bloody aussie bastards. in the us thats a term of endearment…..&& i would add “downhill.” it has the double sense of an easier or improved situation (“it’s all downhill from here”) and a worse or deteriorating situation (“after his divorce he really went downhill”)..&& it addition to the comments about regional application.&& i would add.&& after an admittedly cursory glance at the list.&& that another level of clarification is required.&& if it is to be of much use. for example: 1) some of the different meanings apply to only one part of speech (e.g. when used as a noun or verb.&& etc.; and/or 2) some apply to only one particular fixed expression; and/or 3) some apply when the verb is used transitively (and vice versa – the other meaning intransitively)..&& the list is wrong..&& do not form opinions unless the are reasonable. do not accept that which is neither reasonable or personal..&& should go back over the list. some aren’t applicable. for example.&& puzzle. how is pondering a puzzle the opposite of a puzzle? it’s defining the very same thing. that one was flagrant..&& now if puzzle meant to both ponder and to entirely ignore.&& that would be a contronym..&& wear and weather both have the same meanings. to deteriorate is to withstand (and not be destroyed) a 90 year old man could be said to have weathered the tests of time.&& yet he would also clearly be weathered. there is no 90 year old man who isn’t weathered and hasn’t weathered.&& so they can’t be contronyms. if there could be a 90 year old man who looked 25.&& i’d give it to you.&& but weathering implies taking a beating and surviving.&& not remaining pretty..&& good stuff. not quite the same thing.&& but this discussion brings to mind some word play items i enjoy…. ” a part ” versus ” apart ” two separate words implies together. one word implies separation..&& parking in driveways. driving on parkways..&& am i late to the party?.&& i see “bill” but not “check” which can be “a paper document (such as in a restaurant) showing an amount owed” or “a paper document showing an amount paid”. that always confused me as a little kid. “thanks for the check.&& i’m paying it with a check. next time give me a bill and i’ll pay it with a bill.”.&& thanks.&& english..&& your minds amuse me..&& reply to raymond while guest and host came from the same p. i. e.&& ghost has ‘appeared’ from different root. i first encountered the fruedean heimlech in a novel “house of leaves”.&& it is uncanny that i was wondering just yesterday about a ‘scene’ described in it wherein the protagonist may (would) burn pages to read a book (note that pages are also called leaves).&& more a conundrum than a contranym..&& as an english teacher.&& now retired.&& i’ve been collecting collecting pairs of words similar to contranyms for many years. i called them anti-homophones (opposite in meaning “anti” and sounds alike “homophone”).&& since i couldn’t find a source that knew the correct term. i even wrote a letter to “christy.&& the wordsmilth” who had a radio show on public radio. now i find there are many terms. can “contronyms” be spelled differently.&& for example “raise” and “raze”? i’d also like to add “wad” (small amount .&& as in a paper wad to be shot out of a straw.&& and “wad” (a large amount.&& as in a wad of money that could choke a horse..&& i do believe that some of the contronyms listed require a bit of a stretch and some contextual massaging. many of these have been pointed out by earlier posts..&& how about “revolution”?.&& 1.&& to change dramatically and irrevocably 2. to end exactly where one started.&& coming full circle..&& “shell” is a contronym in 2 different senses..&& as a noun.&& it can mean a cannon’s projectile or the part of ordinance that is not the projectile (in a shotgun or rifle.&& for instance)..&& as a verb.&& it can mean to remove shells from something or send shells towards something:.&& remove: “we shelled these pistachios.” towards: “we shelled the rebels for 30 minutes.&& but they’re still fighting back.”.&& inflammable = not flammable or easily set on fire.&& unlockable.&& 1. meaning that it is not possible to lock the door i.e. it is not lockable..&& 2. meaning that you can unlock the door i.e. you can unlock it..&& constrain. it could mean to compel someone to a certain action.&& but it could also mean to prevent/restrain from a said course..&& i only agree with a very few of these. most of them are not true opposites. for instance the act of “bolting” is running away. securing is not the opposite. garnish is the one word that is perfect. as i read them.&& only “dust” really fits the definition. law terms and non-modern / other languages are not correct. anything over one word is a phrase.&& and by using the proper second word.&& you can easily say the opposite..&& also.&& the word “execute” can mean to begin (to execute a plan) to venture forth. conversely.&& execute can also mean to end or kill something or someone. “if we execute the plan correctly.&& person a will be executed.” (no actually plan to harm anyone.&& sentence used simply as an example.).&& i know “literally” has now been overused as emphasis.&& however.&& what are the feelings on its use ironically? i think people are now beginning to transition from using it incorrectly to now using it for comic effect..&& even the word “terrific” could be a contromym. depending on the tone of the sentence.&& this word can be used in a positive sense and otherwise.

my write ups on writing are more focused on structure and persuasion, but i’m digging deep into the grammar technicalities. it’s fun to learn all these rules and structures! lol., judyon september 29, 2011 4:13 pm i sent my comments through the contact button. if they don’t show up here in a little while, i will use this space to post them. basically i noted that “cleave” and “refrain” aren’t actually contranyms, because each is an example of two separate words which have always had separate meanings, but have acquired the same spelling., wastrelon december 27, 2011 3:37 pm thank you brian for bringing that up. i also found that website, and i’d like to mention that “contronym” is perhaps not the best word for these difficult words. first, it might be, and perhaps should be, “contranym” with an “a” instead of an “o”. second, either way, it combines a prefix derived from latin with “nym” derived from greek. for that reason, i think “antagonym” is preferable because both parts are derived from greek., raymondon january 20, 2012 2:26 am freud noticed an identical phenomenon in german in his essay “the uncanny.” “heimlich” has a secondary meaning synonymous with “unheimlich.” i also read somewhere that “guest” and “host” both come from the same indo-european root that means both, a word which also gave rise to the word “ghost.”, peteron may 10, 2012 5:41 pm americans say we have a right to be tried by a jury of their peers. but a peer jury is the right of the british nobility to be tried by their peers (the house of lords). americans are only guaranteed a right by trial in front of an impartial jury since we don’t have peers., john middlemason october 17, 2012 6:46 am i would also be interested in words of single meaning that contradict themselves so should not be in the dictionary. for example, the word “indefinable” when applied, appears a blatant logical contradiction. it is an adjective. so it modifies a definable noun or pronoun. how can something definable be modified to something indefinable? e.g. an indefinable terror. terror is definable since there are a finite list of terrors people can experience. so it can’t be indefinable. i wonder if this word should be allowed in the dictionary. contradictions can seriously deceive people., john middlemason october 17, 2012 7:34 am here’s another one:- nothingness. it is a noun, hence the subject of a verb but nothingness cannot be anything except nothingness. it cannot be a noun, nor verb, nor any word at all. contradiction! so this word must be a delusion. i don’t think it should be in the dictionary unless people like being deceived., john bejaranoon april 03, 2013 1:22 pm my favorite is “pitch”, a double autoantonym. pitch can mean to actively promote or encourage acceptance of (i pitched my screenplay to the producer.), or to discard (that toner cartridge is empty. you should pitch it.) pitch can also mean a level surface (the soccer players have come out onto the pitch.), or a steep incline (the roofer charged me extra due to the steep pitch of my roof.), socraticgadflyon april 03, 2013 3:32 pm dictionary.com says the “all” version of “aught” means “at all, in any respect,” not an “omni-.” the two meanings of “consult” are not antonymic at all. that would be to receive advice or reject it. definitely on “quite.” its two meanings aren’t even close to antonymic. and, that’s just a brief bit of grammar police. let’s not over extend “a way with cuteness with words.”, aeginaon december 28, 2013 3:56 am i agree that “literally” to mean “virtually” is ridiculous. socraticgadfly has a point: some of these words are not contradictory, but complementary (lease, rent, etc.) the same word describes participation in either end of a transaction (much as, if i’m not mistaken, “prestar” means either “to borrow” or “to lend” in spanish.) i’m tempted to say that, strictly speaking, words that are not the same party of speech cannot be opposites, and to point out that “left” takes different auxiliary verbs in each of its “contrary” meanings — but i would risk being overly fussy and pedantic. 🙂, chuckieon may 26, 2014 10:14 pm like sally, i too am from australia. however, i disagree with some of the meanings corrected by her. for instance, i would use the word ‘consult’ in both ways the article describes. many people i know, including myself, would say clip to cut/disconnect something and to join something together – not necessarily a clip(!). another example would be skin, it is used as a verb and a noun; transparent is arguable as well… i also believe a refrain, in music at least, is a repetition, sally. (and yes, i do realise that these comments are old…) thanks :>, danon may 30, 2014 1:53 am you forgot outstanding… 1. excellent 2. unfinished or incomplete…outstanding debt your work is outstanding! (excellent work, above average) you have outstanding work, please turn it in. (incomplete, unfinished ), pathetic freakon june 03, 2014 7:17 pm after reading paul’s comments i wonder if maybe back in 2011, is it that back then he was just ignorant or a complete dumbass. there are obviously opposite words in addition to the same word meaning its opposite. yes you can clip something together or unclip it, however you can also remove something by clipping it. i’ve never heard of anyone unclipping their dog’s ears, only clipping them (just for paul: which means removing a portion of it). *** “literally [its opposite is not ‘literally’!]” this literally is the dumbest thing i have ever heard, because i literally just threw up in my mouth, literally. “mean [this is never excellent]”, what do you mean exactly? oh, exactly that? presently [always means soon]”, except that i am presently working on tearing you down. i’m not going to do this soon, i am presently working on it, i might even stop and tell someone i am presently working on it and then come back to it and presume my present state of action. and finally, where did any of this say it was australian grammar. believe me when i say that within the states, there are differences in grammar and meaning of english words just from different regions. have you ever watch english tv and us tele? they use words all the time that mean a complete opposite to the other. bloody aussie bastards. in the us thats a term of endearment…., ethan placeon august 14, 2014 5:33 pm i would add “downhill.” it has the double sense of an easier or improved situation (“it’s all downhill from here”) and a worse or deteriorating situation (“after his divorce he really went downhill”)., victoron january 20, 2015 10:02 am it addition to the comments about regional application, i would add, after an admittedly cursory glance at the list, that another level of clarification is required, if it is to be of much use. for example: 1) some of the different meanings apply to only one part of speech (e.g. when used as a noun or verb, etc.; and/or 2) some apply to only one particular fixed expression; and/or 3) some apply when the verb is used transitively (and vice versa – the other meaning intransitively)., johnon february 04, 2015 10:58 am the list is wrong. do not form opinions unless the are reasonable. do not accept that which is neither reasonable or personal., joshuaon february 23, 2015 11:18 pm should go back over the list. some aren’t applicable. for example, puzzle. how is pondering a puzzle the opposite of a puzzle? it’s defining the very same thing. that one was flagrant. now if puzzle meant to both ponder and to entirely ignore, that would be a contronym. wear and weather both have the same meanings. to deteriorate is to withstand (and not be destroyed) a 90 year old man could be said to have weathered the tests of time, yet he would also clearly be weathered. there is no 90 year old man who isn’t weathered and hasn’t weathered, so they can’t be contronyms. if there could be a 90 year old man who looked 25, i’d give it to you, but weathering implies taking a beating and surviving, not remaining pretty., kton may 04, 2015 6:32 pm good stuff. not quite the same thing, but this discussion brings to mind some word play items i enjoy…. ” a part ” versus ” apart ” two separate words implies together. one word implies separation. parking in driveways. driving on parkways., snooj dowdyon august 14, 2015 2:47 am am i late to the party? i see “bill” but not “check” which can be “a paper document (such as in a restaurant) showing an amount owed” or “a paper document showing an amount paid”. that always confused me as a little kid. “thanks for the check, i’m paying it with a check. next time give me a bill and i’ll pay it with a bill.” thanks, english., bill cipheron september 30, 2015 5:28 am your minds amuse me., makon december 02, 2015 7:24 pm reply to raymond while guest and host came from the same p. i. e, ghost has ‘appeared’ from different root. i first encountered the fruedean heimlech in a novel “house of leaves”, it is uncanny that i was wondering just yesterday about a ‘scene’ described in it wherein the protagonist may (would) burn pages to read a book (note that pages are also called leaves), more a conundrum than a contranym., jimon december 21, 2015 1:41 pm as an english teacher, now retired, i’ve been collecting collecting pairs of words similar to contranyms for many years. i called them anti-homophones (opposite in meaning “anti” and sounds alike “homophone”), since i couldn’t find a source that knew the correct term. i even wrote a letter to “christy, the wordsmilth” who had a radio show on public radio. now i find there are many terms. can “contronyms” be spelled differently, for example “raise” and “raze”? i’d also like to add “wad” (small amount , as in a paper wad to be shot out of a straw, and “wad” (a large amount, as in a wad of money that could choke a horse. i do believe that some of the contronyms listed require a bit of a stretch and some contextual massaging. many of these have been pointed out by earlier posts., allen rubinsteinon december 24, 2015 5:36 am how about “revolution”? 1, to change dramatically and irrevocably 2. to end exactly where one started, coming full circle., br. billon december 31, 2015 4:34 pm “shell” is a contronym in 2 different senses. as a noun, it can mean a cannon’s projectile or the part of ordinance that is not the projectile (in a shotgun or rifle, for instance). as a verb, it can mean to remove shells from something or send shells towards something: remove: “we shelled these pistachios.” towards: “we shelled the rebels for 30 minutes, but they’re still fighting back.”, colin brownon january 04, 2016 7:27 am inflammable = not flammable or easily set on fire, lewison january 17, 2016 12:21 pm unlockable 1. meaning that it is not possible to lock the door i.e. it is not lockable. 2. meaning that you can unlock the door i.e. you can unlock it., joel lefevreon january 19, 2016 5:33 pm constrain. it could mean to compel someone to a certain action, but it could also mean to prevent/restrain from a said course., rick dashiellon january 29, 2016 3:56 pm i only agree with a very few of these. most of them are not true opposites. for instance the act of “bolting” is running away. securing is not the opposite. garnish is the one word that is perfect. as i read them, only “dust” really fits the definition. law terms and non-modern / other languages are not correct. anything over one word is a phrase, and by using the proper second word, you can easily say the opposite., peter thwingon february 27, 2016 9:02 pm also, the word “execute” can mean to begin (to execute a plan) to venture forth. conversely, execute can also mean to end or kill something or someone. “if we execute the plan correctly, person a will be executed.” (no actually plan to harm anyone, sentence used simply as an example.), rosson april 18, 2016 2:12 pm i know “literally” has now been overused as emphasis, however, what are the feelings on its use ironically? i think people are now beginning to transition from using it incorrectly to now using it for comic effect., nickon july 03, 2016 11:53 pm even the word “terrific” could be a contromym. depending on the tone of the sentence, this word can be used in a positive sense and otherwise. (example, wonderful and awful), dnon december 07, 2016 7:39 pm there are some good comments i don’t have to reiterate, however what i don’t see, whether we are talking expressions or proper english is the correct use of the word “continue” as meaning to suspend something. for that the word “discontinue” would be the correct word to use. i believe that is used in the queen’s english as well as in the u.s. and canada., jonathan davison december 13, 2016 8:06 pm i do not agree on oversight as a legitimate noun form of oversee. this was a recent american mistaken meaning that has been rather hilarious. american oversight committees remain committees apparently constituted to fail to notice things. they should be overseeing committees, roberton february 23, 2017 4:10 pm i’m from the us, where to “table” a bill in congress means to put it aside. but i live in uganda, where “tabling” a bill means to bring it forward to the table, for consideration. i’m not sure what the uk meaning is, but i’m curious to find out., dagon march 22, 2017 8:28 am in terms of use/purpose, shape and materials, i’d like to offer shaft (n). whether made or found, it is (or looks like) a long solid object that has something useful at one or both ends (or had or might have) – such as a tool or wheel. or it can be a cavity in a solid that has very similar shape and also has (‘or’s as above) useful stuff at one or both ends – such as fresh air, living space, or ore – or it just looks like one., mr bananapants esq.on june 13, 2017 9:20 pm you can add liberal (political) and liberal (philosophical), bobon june 25, 2017 12:07 am i have a few egregious examples: egregious: outstandingly bad, or remarkably good. literally: literally, or figuratively “i literally died laughing when he literally couldn’t even remember how old he was” undoable: unable to be done, able to be undone. bail: to remove water from a ship in an effort to save it, to flee a ship before it sinks. “first, we tried to bail water from the ship. that didn’t work, so we bailed and swam to shore.” book: to make a reservation, to leave a place. “we booked a hotel.” “we booked it from the hotel.” can: to be able to do something, to reject something. “we can do that” “that won’t work. can that idea”, business writing, book reviews, mistakes, expressions, fiction writing, freelance writing, general, grammar, grammar 101, misused words, punctuation, spelling, style, vocabulary, writing basics, usage review, writing quizzes, home, archives, exercises, about, contact, privacy policy]
