low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol. aim to keep this bad cholesterol under 100 mg/dl, or 2.6 mmol/l. if you have a history of heart attacks or youre at a very high risk of a heart attack or

who have had heart attacks, strokes caused by blockages in a blood vessel, ministrokes (transient ischemic attacks), peripheral artery disease, or prior surgery to open or replace coronary arteries., people who have very high ldl (bad) cholesterol. this group includes adults who have ldl cholesterol levels of 190 mg/dl (4.92 mmol/l) or higher., people who have diabetes. this group includes adults 40 to 75 who have diabetes and an ldl cholesterol level between 70 and 189 mg/dl (1.8 and 4.9 mmol/l), especially if they have evidence of blood vessel disease or other risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure or smoking., quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke, eat a healthy diet rich in vegetables, fruits, fish and whole grains and low in saturated fat, trans fat, refined carbohydrates and salt, be physically active more often and sit less, maintain a healthy weight, headaches, nausea, muscle and joint aches, increased blood sugar or type 2 diabetes. its possible that your blood sugar (blood glucose) level may slightly increase when you take a statin, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. this is especially likely if your blood sugar is already high. however, the benefit of taking a statin may outweigh that risk. people with diabetes who take statins have much lower risks of heart attacks., muscle cell damage. very rarely, high-dose statin use can cause muscle cells to break down and release a protein called myoglobin into the bloodstream. this can lead to severe muscle pain and kidney damage., liver damage. occasionally, statin use causes an increase in liver enzymes. if the increase is mild, you can continue to take the drug. low to moderate doses of statins dont appear to severely raise liver enzyme levels., memory problems. some people have reported memory loss and thinking problems after using statins. but a number of studies havent been able to find any evidence to prove that statins actually cause these difficulties. other studies suggest that statins may help prevent these issues., do i have other risk factors for heart and blood vessel disease?, am i willing and able to make lifestyle changes to improve my health?, am i
