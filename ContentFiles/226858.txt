[for 30 years, randall has spoken to teachers around the world on a broad landscape of topics including educational technology, language assessment, various instructional methodologies, human connection and authenticity, and the grief experienced with loss and death. contact randall if you are interested in having him speak at your institution or event in 2022-2023., here are some of his presentations:, , date: july 1, 2022, title of plenary presentation: think better, act better: an approach to global citizenship, plenary summary:, title: fostering emotionally-healthy learning environments for teachers and students, plenary summary:, as human beings, we are constantly drawing conclusions about other people, often beyond our awareness, and these attitudes and beliefs are shaped in part by the information that we read, see, hear, and share. such information possesses vast power to enlighten and engender a more compassionate humanity, but it can wield the sword of injustice, prejudice, and intolerance, often with devastating consequences on the most vulnerable groups in society., with this in mind, educators have a far-reaching responsibility to empower students with the ability to sift through an overwhelming flood of unfiltered ideas in the media and on the internet that influences opinion and policy. without such constructive guidance, it can be difficult for students to examine information with the tools of critical thinking and philosophical inquiry that would lead to responsible action in the public arena (think better, act better). , in this presentation, randall addresses these concerns and provides an approach on how teachers on the front lines can help their students develop strategies to analyze and interpret information, leading to more gracious attitudes and actions toward our local communities and global neighbors., date: april 9, 2022, title of plenary presentation: fostering emotionally-healthy learning environments for teachers and students, download handout: pdf, plenary summary:, title: fostering emotionally-healthy learning environments for teachers and students, plenary summary:, in 2017, randall attempted a grueling 100-mile ultramarathon, but after running and hiking for 70 miles, randall dropped out of the race in utter physical and emotional exhaustion. feeling completely dejected, randall curled up in the back of his vehicle at the starting area and adamantly vowed never to do it again. however, despite his earlier declaration, randall entered another 100-mile event only six weeks later with almost the same devastating results. then, on the verge of dropping from the race at 3:30 a.m., with 26 miles to go, something happened that radically transformed his life., as a metaphor for our profession, randall first recounts his running journey with great candor and then compares such emotional and physical challenges to the profound struggle that many teachers and students face on a daily basis, wondering whether they should continue teaching or studying. finally, randall describes five pivotal keys of self-realization, authenticity, courage, empathy, and emotional support that can foster healthy learning environments at home, in schools, and in our communities., date: october 2021, title of keynote presentation: surviving and thriving in the new pandemic era, web site: https://ortesol.wildapricot.org/, plenary summary:, by the end of 2019, the word, covid-19, still hadn’t entered our daily vocabulary, and its tsunami-like impact was only on the distant horizon for most of the world, having not permeated into every aspect of our lives. however, since then, life on this planet has been radically altered, and countless millions—billions—of people have been affected—physically, socially, economically, and emotionally. furthermore, teachers, students, families, and educational systems have been turned upside down as they have learned to adapt to the challenges in learning and growing in this new normal., with vulnerability and raw candor, randall shares how the pandemic has changed his personal and professional life and provides six keys to experiencing innovation and growth into the future., date: june 2021, title of plenary presentation: how online learning can retool minds and reshape hearts , download handout:  pdf, web site: http://www.cilex.mx, keynote summary:, although the internet can be a source of almost unlimited information, the challenge facing learners is the ability to understand how misinformation can lead to faulty assumptions and thinking errors, and potentially negative actions toward others., in this presentation, randall discusses these concerns and shares ways in which educators can use information to reshape the ways learners think and act, leading to a more gracious humanity., title: gamifying the classroom for language assessment needs the presenters demonstrate three engaging games and simulation activities that teachers can use to maximize language learning or cross-cultural understanding in their face-to-face or online classrooms. this is supported with a basic model on how to

become better active listeners? this session reviews factors that make listening difficult for language learners and demonstrates interactive and realistic activities for both high- and low-resource environments that teach, not just test, effective listening skills. ideas for both face-to-face and online classes are addressed., presenters: randall davis (united states), mouna bouhlel (tunisia), pragya adhikari (nepal), and keilor vargas (costa rica), facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/betaboliviatesoliatefl, web site: https://www.betabolivia.org/, plenary title: reimagining the traditional paradigm of professional development , download handout: here, summary:, since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, many teachers around the world have felt disconnected, unprepared, and upended in their work because this global situation has fractured many of the traditional ways of teaching and learning. as a result, teachers have struggled to find a future place for themselves in a profession with limited opportunities to engage in meaningful professional development in a remote environment. that said, great creativity and innovation can blossom amid disruption and chaos. in response to this great educational upheaval, randall explains how old ways of doing professional development must give way to new paradigms of support for our profession to not only survive, but thrive in today’s world. to this end, randall proposes three fundamental changes to his work that reflect this new vision for the future., best practices session: new twists, tricks, and tools to enhance your online lessons, download handout: here, summary:, with online learning becoming the backbone of instruction around the world, teachers are trying to come up with new ways of enhancing their teaching and the learning experience. unfortunately, teachers often have very little training on how to maximize the potential of online instruction and feel lost on how to navigate these uncharted waters. in response to this, randall introduces a potpourri of tools, tips, and secrets on (1) running an engaging online class through popular web-conferencing platforms, (2) choosing microphones, green screens, and webcams to create quality classroom content, and (3) creating meaningful language assessment strategies to access students’ skills.  , title: building human connection
