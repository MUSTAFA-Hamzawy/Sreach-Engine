[click on the questions below to learn more about the idioms and activities., one of the challenges to learning any language is to understand and use idioms in everyday conversation. although there exist many idiom dictionaries for north american english, learners (1) often cannot find enough sample sentences to learn how these expressions are used in different contexts and (2) don’t have speaking opportunities to practice the idioms in conversation., in response to this need, i create short videos that introduce idioms with these goals:, learners need to know how common an idiom is used in actual conversation.  i don’t want you to try to use these idioms and find out no one uses them at all. i mean, who wants to sound out-of-touch with the modern world by using expressions only known to william shakespeare. with this in mind, i try to indicate how frequently these idioms are used based on my interviews with other native speakers in the united states.  i use these general identifiers:, frequency: high, frequency: medium, frequency: low, all of the activities can be done by learners on their own. however, because the lessons are designed to increase learners’ comprehension and speaking skills, going through the speaking questions and situations (with a teacher or a study partner) can help learners really master the idioms., i suggest having students work in pairs as they work through the activities., this project is in the early stages of development, with links to activities that have been completed. i hope to add one or two a week., well, i have been developing this web site since 1998, and over the years, my interests have evolved over time along with online services such as youtube and more recently, tiktok. , i have always wanted to help students understand everyday conversations and speaking more naturally, and studying idioms and learning how to use them is one of my focuses now., , absolutely. feel free to send me a suggestion for consideration., a fish out of water, a tough (hard) nut to crack, a piece of cake, all greek to me, , bark up the wrong tree, be in the same boat, beat around the bush, bed of roses , busy as a bee, burn the candle at both ends, , come clean, cost an arm and a leg, cut to the chase, , don’t judge a book by its cover, doze off (also, nod off and out like a light), drive someone crazy, drop out of school, , face the music, foot the bill , , get out of hand, ghost someone (future lesson), go down like a lead balloon, grin from ear to ear, , happy as a clam , harp on (and on) about something, have a ball, have a lot on your plate, in hot water, jump the gun, kick the habit – new (january 31, 2022), kill time, learn the ropes, let sleeping dogs lie (future lesson), let the cat out of the bag, lose it, make ends meet, mend fences , miss the boat , mull over, no picnic, nose around (future lesson), not the sharpest tool in the shed, on the back burner (future lesson), paddle your own canoe (future lesson), pain in the neck (future lesson), paint the town red (future lesson), pipe dream, put a sock in it (future lesson), rack your brains, raise the bar (future lesson), recharge one’s batteries (future lesson), run out of steam (future lesson), , spill the beans (future lesson), sweep something under the rug (future lesson), take a rain check, copyright @ 1998-2022. randall davis. all rights reserved., read complete terms of use for more information., web site info][english idioms, “understanding and using expressions for daily communication”, frequently-asked-questions about idioms, — more to be added —, idioms starting with a, idioms starting with b, idioms starting with c, idioms starting with d, idioms starting with f, idioms starting with g, idioms starting with h, idioms starting with i, idioms starting with j, idioms starting with k, idioms starting with l, idioms starting with m, idioms starting with n, idioms starting with o, idioms starting with p, idioms starting with r, idioms starting with s, idioms starting with t, — more to come —, web site info, other sites:]english idioms -
