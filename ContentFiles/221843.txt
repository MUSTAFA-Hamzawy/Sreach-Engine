[as of march 7, 2021 we are no longer collecting new data., data for march 7, 2021, csvapi, see hhs hospitalization data on a map., us states and territories report data in differing units and with varying definitions. our national summary cases, tests, and outcomes numbers are simple sums of the data states and territories provide, but because of the disparate metrics they include, they should be considered estimates., we calculate daily changes based on the data states report each day. some states report new cases, tests, and deaths using other methods. please consult official state data sources for more information. we chart “new tests” using different units across jurisdictions, because not all states and territories report tests in the same units. learn more about total test units and see what we chart for each jurisdiction in our total tests documentation., we do not have a complete dataset for every metric in every state. if we have data for less than 30% of the past 90 days for a given metric, you’ll see a warning instead of a chart for that metric., all the data for these charts is available for download. you can also review tabular national data on our us historical data page and data for each state and territory on the individual state or territory’s overview page., state’s dataset was last updated march 7, 2021 11:00 am et, full state data including data
